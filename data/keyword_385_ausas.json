AUSA reviews of FBI files identified a single interview on or about August 7, 2007 with Florida FBI agents.

Jane Doe could not recall whether she met with the FBI agents once or twice, and suggested that undocumented follow-up interviews might have occurred if new statements were made. AUSA is awaiting a response from a contact regarding SDFL’s awareness of any additional interviews.",

Specifically, the files are not linked to their originating devices, making it impossible to track the full scope of the collection or efficiently review the materials. Attempts to establish a system for tracking the data have been met with delays and unanswered emails. There are concerns about duplicated files and an inability to determine which items are complete versus partial. Multiple parties involved (including CART, Relativity users, and the US Attorney’s office) express frustration with the lack of organization and request a coordinated meeting to address the issues and establish a clear process for reviewing the data. The team is struggling to determine what data has been previously provided, whether files are full or partial, and what devices are associated with the data.",

The government and defense are negotiating redactions to several reply briefs and exhibits, primarily due to the Protective Order designating information as \"Confidential.\" Key points include: *   **Redaction Proposals:** The defense proposes filing briefs and exhibits without redactions, arguing that the “Confidential” designation doesn’t justify them. The government, conversely, seeks to redact information related to AUSAs, accusers, and third parties to protect privacy. *   **Specific Redactions:** Redactions are proposed for names of AUSAs and accusers in Reply Brief 3, and for exhibits filed under seal. The government also argues against redaction of language referencing the Indictment in Reply Brief 5. *   **Exhibit A:** The government wants Exhibit A to remain sealed, while the defense initially proposed filing it publicly with redactions. *   **Court Orders:** The discussions are influenced by a court order (Dkt. 203) requiring docketing of joint letters or proposed redactions by April 19, 2021. *   **Scheduling a Conference:** Counsel are coordinating a call to formally discuss the disclosures, deadlines and redaction proposals.",
