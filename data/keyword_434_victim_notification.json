The sender initially misspelled Josephsberg’s name and inquired about Lefkowitz’s inclusion on the email chain. The sender noted that Podhurst and Josephsberg were well-known within the Epstein defense team and had strong reputations. The sender asserted a statutory obligation to notify victims of upcoming events and insisted on the completion of the vetting process by November 28, 2007, threatening to authorize victim notification if objections were not provided. A draft notification letter to the victims was planned for distribution after November 29, 2007.",

Victim notifications are still being requested, though the court lacks a procedure for providing separate rooms for victims.

Key points include: *   **Investigation Details:** The investigation involved notifying potential victims (specifically, those represented by Bradley Edwards) through victim notification letters provided by the FBI and Villafafia. *   **Deferred Prosecution Agreement:**  The U.S. Attorney’s Office and Epstein’s attorneys reached an agreement in 2007 to defer federal prosecution in exchange for Florida state prosecution, contingent on a federal remedy for the victims. This included a specific provision allowing victims to pursue federal claims as if Epstein had been convicted federally. *   **Victim Notification and Concerns:** Despite efforts to notify victims, some, like “Jane Doe” (referred to throughout), were resistant to involvement. Concerns arose that victims might exaggerate their claims for increased damages. *   **Attorney Edwards’ Role:**  Attorney Edwards represented several clients involved in the case and attempted to influence the investigation, but his communication was often indirect and lacked clear coordination. *   **Limitations on Notification:**  Due to legal constraints, the U.S. Attorney’s Office could not include all identified victims in an indictment, limiting the scope of the federal remedy. *   **Legal Basis:** The declaration is made under penalty of perjury and references relevant U.S. Code sections.",

Key points of contention include: *   **Independent Review:** The purported “independent de novo review” conducted by CEOS was neither independent (as the reviewer had previously assessed the prosecution memo) nor de novo (it only reviewed for abuse of discretion). *   **Notification of Witnesses:** The defense’s objections to notifying witnesses were dismissed, and the resulting letter was misleading. *   **Mischaracterization of Defense Arguments:** The defense’s arguments regarding the statute and victim claims were misrepresented by Lefkowitz. *   **Deferred Prosecution Agreement:** The SDFL’s demands regarding a deadline and an assigned attorney representative were presented unilaterally and were not agreed to. *   **Victim Compensation:** The agreement to assign victim compensation to an independent third party was a result of the defense’s discovery of a misleading disclosure and was not an “unilateral” decision. *   **Timetable Manipulation:** Lefkowitz attempted to impose a restrictive timetable to derail the review process. The document concludes by demanding a thorough, independent de novo review of the case, emphasizing the need to base the review on witness testimony rather than conclusions from the prosecution.",

This agreement included a provision to offer federal victims the same rights as if Epstein had been federally prosecuted. *   **Confidentiality Concerns:** The Attorney raised concerns about victims potentially exaggerating their involvement for damages claims and sought to limit notification to prevent witness intimidation. *   **Edwards’ Representation:** Attorney James Eisenberg represented several of Epstein’s clients, and Edwards attempted to utilize his influence to affect the outcome of the case. *   **Delayed Notification & Dispute:** A key point of contention is the timing of notification to some victims, specifically regarding the plea agreement hearing. Edwards’ delayed communication and subsequent disagreement over the scope of the agreement prompted further notification efforts. *   **Limited Scope:** Due to a stipulation in the agreement, the U.S. Attorney was unable to include certain victims in an indictment, limiting the extent of the federal remedy.

This confidentiality was justified to protect the integrity of the investigation. *   **Venue Provisions:** The government argues that Section 3771(d)(3) of the CVRA, which specifies the venue for asserting victim rights in the absence of prosecution, doesn't create a right to consultation *before* a prosecution begins. *   **Applicable Rights:** The government acknowledges that certain rights under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) (e.g., protection from the accused, reasonable delay) *do* apply prior to prosecution, but others (referring to “public court proceeding”) only apply after criminal proceedings have commenced. **Overall:** The government argues the petitioner’s claims are based on a misinterpretation of the CVRA and that it fulfilled its obligations to the victim through proactive notification and efforts to secure victim rights.",

The final list of 32 victims was provided, and copies of notification letters were to be carbon-copied to Epstein’s attorney and Josefsberg’s attorney. Confirmation of payment for Josefsberg’s fees was requested. Language for notifications was taken verbatim from the Agreement and Addendum, with victim names replacing “identified individual.”  A notification of the judge’s ruling was required in the Jane Doe 1 and 2 v. United States case, with adjusted language directing victims to consult with Josefsberg. The Office’s position is that the Agreement and Addendum dictate the process, and the Office intends to enforce its right to indict Epstein if breached. Acosta requested a prompt response regarding attorney contact and fee documentation to facilitate distribution of revised notifications.",

The Attorney sent letters informing victims of the resolution, including offering an attorney-representative (Robert Josefsberg) and instructed the attorney to convey the information to the victim.

He describes being offered protection and leverage (“looked after”) if he remained silent. He subsequently ended contact with Epstein when he proposed a situation involving his child. *   **Details of Interactions:** Edwards recounts conversations with Epstein where he repeatedly discredited the girls involved and expressed a lack of concern for their well-being. He was sent to Thailand to meet a girl and complete a short massage course. *   **Victim Notification:** Edwards was eventually notified as a victim through the US Attorney's Office. The transcript is part of Government Exhibit C, Case No. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA, and is filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court.",

It was generated on December 24, 2025. The investigation, initiated in 2005 following a complaint about Epstein, led to a state indictment in 2006. The FBI subsequently opened a federal investigation, leading to a draft indictment and a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) negotiated and signed in 2007.  The NPA involved Epstein pleading guilty to state charges and agreeing to specific conditions, including registering as a sexual offender. The Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigated allegations that the USAO improperly resolved the case by negotiating the NPA and failing to consult with victims. OPR focused on the actions of the U.S. Attorney, three supervisors, and the Assistant U.S. Attorney involved. The investigation involved a lengthy period of negotiation, with Epstein’s attorneys attempting to modify the NPA terms.  The government ultimately entered into the NPA, securing Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration.  Following the NPA’s signing, a victim filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) due to the government’s failure to consult with victims. OPR found that while the USAO’s handling of the case resulted in poor judgment and a lack of transparency regarding its communications with victims, none of the involved individuals committed professional misconduct.  Specifically, OPR determined that the NPA was not a violation of any legal standards, and while there were shortcomings in the government’s interactions with victims that contributed to public criticism, the government did not act with ill intent or a deliberate effort to silence or mislead victims. The investigation concluded with Epstein’s death in 2018 and the dismissal of the federal charges, as well as a court’s dismissal of the CVRA case due to the case’s “mook” status. OPR noted that the USAO’s lack of transparency contributed to negative public perception and underscored the importance of government communication with victims of crime.",
