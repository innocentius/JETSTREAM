He emphasized the DOJ’s standard practice of not commenting on witness interviews and maintaining confidentiality.  He highlighted that Prince Andrew had expressed a desire to cooperate. Subsequently, on January 27, 2020, the Assistant U.S. Attorney emailed further, correcting a public misimpression created by Prince Andrew regarding his willingness to cooperate, asserting that he had not provided any such cooperation.  This prompted Bloxsome to push back, arguing that the DOJ’s statements were inaccurate and detrimental to Prince Andrew’s efforts to cooperate. A series of follow-up emails occurred between January 28th and January 20th, primarily revolving around scheduling a preliminary phone call to discuss the matter.  The DOJ continued to express its desire for an interview and the need for confirmation of the Duke’s willingness to participate. The correspondence detailed the DOJ’s prior attempts to contact the Duke and the lack of a response. The emails revealed ongoing concerns about the potential for public misinterpretations regarding the Duke’s cooperation.",

The correspondence highlights a struggle to coordinate efforts, establish clear protocols, and efficiently utilize the available resources to analyze the massive volume of digital evidence.

Initially, the Court addressed a “Curcio issue” – a confidential matter involving counsel for Mr. Tartaglione, Ms. Sternheim. The primary focus shifted to the government’s request to seal letters regarding prison conditions, prison designation, and Mr. Tartaglione’s housing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) and Medium Medium Correctional Facility (MDC). The government sought to seal letters dated August 23rd and 28th, arguing it protected BOP’s deliberative process and prevented inmates from manipulating housing assignments. The Court ultimately ruled that the letters *were* judicial documents due to their relevance to Mr. Tartaglione’s trial rights and the court’s oversight. The Court then rejected the government's argument to maintain the seal, ordering its unsealing due to a lack of demonstrated compelling interest and concerns about potential manipulation of security protocols. Finally, the court addressed concerns about a telephone seized from Mr. Tartaglione, and the government abandoned the effort to obtain a warrant for it. Counsel proposed a timeline for trial scheduling, pending further discussion with the government.",
