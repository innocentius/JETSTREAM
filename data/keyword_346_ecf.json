Kahn, and Ghislaine Maxwell, alleging sexual assault, battery, emotional distress, and false imprisonment. *   **Dismissal Motion:** Doe moved to dismiss the case under Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, citing the ongoing criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. *   **Criminal Prosecution:** Maxwell is being prosecuted in the Southern District of New York for related criminal charges (ECF No. 20-CR-330). *   **Victims’ Compensation Program:** The Epstein Estate established a compensation program for victims, and Doe accepted an offer, requiring dismissal with prejudice. *   **Stipulation and Conditions:** To achieve dismissal, Doe sought to have the case dismissed with prejudice under the terms of a partially executed stipulation. However, Maxwell objected and proposed additional conditions regarding attorney’s fees, costs, and access to the release agreement. *   **Maxwell’s Objections:** Maxwell argued that the stipulation regarding fees and costs was problematic and that she should be allowed to seek fees as the prevailing party and to sue for abuse of process. She also requested a copy of the unredacted release agreement. *   **Court’s Order:** The Court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, subject to the proposed conditions – modification of the fee and cost provision, allowing Maxwell to seek fees as the prevailing party, and providing her with the unredacted release. The parties were given until March 19, 2021, to indicate their agreement.",
