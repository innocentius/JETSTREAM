However, Maxwell objected and proposed additional conditions regarding attorney’s fees, costs, and access to the release agreement. *   **Maxwell’s Objections:** Maxwell argued that the stipulation regarding fees and costs was problematic and that she should be allowed to seek fees as the prevailing party and to sue for abuse of process. She also requested a copy of the unredacted release agreement. *   **Court’s Order:** The Court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, subject to the proposed conditions – modification of the fee and cost provision, allowing Maxwell to seek fees as the prevailing party, and providing her with the unredacted release.
