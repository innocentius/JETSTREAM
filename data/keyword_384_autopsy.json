The FBI and Justice Department’s inspector general are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death, which was ruled a suicide. Key findings include: *   At least one camera’s footage was unusable. *   Protocols regarding checks on Epstein were not followed, with potential falsification of logs being investigated. *   The officers on duty were working overtime and had differing backgrounds. *   Epstein was placed on suicide watch after a July incident and had a series of fluctuating living arrangements with roommates. *   The medical examiner found fractures in Epstein's neck bones, consistent with hanging, but experts caution this requires further investigation. *   The defense team is seeking access to all relevant video footage and intends to conduct an independent investigation.",
