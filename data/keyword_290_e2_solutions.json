The traveler, p, flagged discrepancies: the voucher incorrectly allocated one night of the hotel to the travel card, and it omitted the $70.12 hotel tax paid on the traveler’s personal credit card.  Attached documentation (FOLIODETE_20191115122139.pdf, EFTA00027877) includes the hotel invoice. The default payment method for government travel is the Govt. card, and amendments should be made via the “amend modify” function instead of approval.
