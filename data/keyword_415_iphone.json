The New York and Virgin Islands evidence was divided into three categories: devices seized from Epstein’s residences, electronic devices seized from the New York residence, and electronic devices seized from the Virgin Islands residence.  Access was limited to only some of the devices, with many remaining inaccessible or requiring further processing. The team struggled with identifying and categorizing the data, especially with the large volume of files and difficulties in linking data to specific devices. There were repeated requests for a detailed inventory and spreadsheet of the evidence, along with concerns about the \"taint review\" process and the usability of the data for legal purposes.  A vendor, BRG, was engaged to process the data, but timelines were pushed back due to network issues and difficulties extracting the data from certain devices. Ultimately, the team needed a standardized system for tracking the evidence to ensure effective review and analysis.",
