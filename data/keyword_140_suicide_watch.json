This status applies to inmates exhibiting mental instability due to mental illness, personality disorders, medical issues, or drug effects, but without imminent suicidal ideation. Procedures involve a psychologist’s determination, continuous monitoring in a suicide watch area or designated cell, restricted items, detailed log entries every 15 minutes, and regular rounds by staff. Specific personnel (Psychologist, Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff, etc.) are notified upon placement or removal, and limitations exist regarding the number of inmates a staff member can monitor simultaneously.",

Its purpose is to identify and manage potentially suicidal inmates through staff training and observation. Key changes include: three mock suicide emergency exercises per year (one in the SHU), specific criteria for suicide risk assessments and post-watch reports, designated suicide watch rooms (requiring regional director approval), and procedures for notifying psychology services upon inmate requests for protective custody. The program involves staff training, inmate observation, and documentation of all events. The document references various Bureau directives and standards, including those related to discipline, housing units, psychological services, and use of force.  It establishes a formal process for responding to inmate suicide attempts, including after-action reviews and documentation requirements. Finally, the document details procedures for managing inmates in SHUs and uses of inmate observers within the inmate companion program.",

Procedures exist for inmate telephone usage, with monitoring requirements. *   **Inmate Management:** Protocols for conducting inmate counts (including 30-minute rounds and special accountability), managing SHU inmates (including observation and medication), and addressing suicide risk (including screening and suicide watch procedures). *   **Timeline & Analysis:** The document includes a timeline of events surrounding the death of Noel Epstein, a factual background, and an analysis of specific policy violations observed, namely falsified inmate counts, failure to conduct rounds, lack of cellmates, and violations related to phone/property usage.

They also offered inconsistent accounts regarding notifications made to other staff. *   **Lack of Cell Searches:** The officer failed to properly document cell searches, potentially missing opportunities to assess Epstein’s needs. There were concerns about an excessive amount of linens in his cell. *   **Inaccurate Count:** The 4:00 PM SHU count on August 9, 2019, was inaccurate due to a miscount of inmates, potentially hindering the realization that Inmate 3 was no longer present. *   **Draft Status:** The document is a draft and subject to revision, emphasizing the sensitivity of the information contained within.

Over the following weeks, he underwent multiple psychology evaluations, risk assessments, and interactions with attorneys, often with inconsistencies in documentation, particularly regarding cell assignments tracked in SENTRY.  There were documented instances of misplaced SENTRY transactions and errors in records, including inaccurate inmate counts and missing documentation like intake screenings and 30-day psychology reviews.  On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell, prompting a medical emergency and ultimately his death. The investigation into the incident was inconclusive. The review highlighted significant failures in basic correctional practices, including incomplete inmate counts, inconsistent documentation, and failures to adhere to established suicide prevention protocols. Recommendations were made regarding staff training, institutional processes, and oversight. The estimated cost associated with the incident was approximately $10,741.60.",

McFarland describes her role in responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s time at the MCC. Here’s a breakdown of the key factual content: *   **McFarland's Role:** She coordinates searches at the MCC when FOIA requests require it, working primarily with GOP’s Central Office. *   **Search Activities:** She directed staff to search various systems and files, including electronic and non-electronic records, the SENTRY database, email systems (SENTRY and TRULINCS), and the BEMR medical record system. *   **Specific Records Examined:** The searches focused on records related to: SHU log entries, Epstein’s quarters history, CIM clearance data, disciplinary records, intake screening forms, security designations, inmate profiles, incident reports, medical reports, visitor logs, phone logs, email communications, and special investigative reports. *   **Findings:** The searches primarily yielded information already documented in the Christenson Declaration. Key findings included: most records related to Epstein had been handed over to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and that MCC staff located some responsive records through their own searches, often overlapping with Central Office’s findings. Notably, no meeting minutes related to Epstein’s suicide watch removal were located. *   **Confirmation:** McFarland confirmed that no other individuals at the MCC (or former employees) were reasonably likely to possess responsive records.",

These revisions primarily focus on improving inmate safety and supervision, specifically regarding cellmate assignments after suicide watch, ensuring continued care for high-risk inmates, standardizing social/legal visit procedures, improving inmate whereabouts tracking, clarifying Lieutenant round procedures, and enhancing institutional security camera systems. The FBOP is undertaking these revisions through the standard BOP policy development and Union negotiation process, acknowledging that changes are possible. They are also addressing staffing shortages through a variety of initiatives, including incentive programs and automation tools, while awaiting OPM decisions on special salary rate requests. Finally, the FBOP is implementing a monthly security camera reporting system.",

      "summary": "The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is responding to the Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) final report regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. The BOP has completed a review and offers an update on its plans to address six recommendations made by the OIG. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: *   **Overall Approach:** The BOP is revising Program Statements (5321.09, 5324.08, 5500.14, 5500.15, 4200.12) to comply with the OIG’s recommendations. These revisions require adherence to the standard BOP policy development and Union negotiation processes, meaning changes are subject to modification. *   **Specific Recommendations & Responses:** *   **Cellmate Assignment:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5321.09 to establish a process for assigning cellmates after suicide watch, with exceptions considered. *   **Continued Cellmate Placement:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5321.09 to ensure inmates at high risk remain with a cellmate until recommendations are changed. *   **Social/Legal Visit Approvals:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5324.08 to standardize the process for obtaining approvals for social/legal visits for inmates on suicide watch. *   **Inmate Wellbeing Accounting:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5500.14 to improve accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. *   **Lieutenant Round Procedures:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5500.14 to clarify Lieutenant procedures during rounds. *   **Staffing Shortages:** The BOP is analyzing staffing incentives and reducing incentive spending due to budget constraints. They are also exploring funding options for a nationwide special salary rate. *   **Security Camera Systems:** The BOP is revising Program Statements 5500.15 and 4200.12 to mandate video recording capacity and regular system functionality checks. *   **OIG Monitoring:** The OIG will continue to monitor the BOP’s progress and consider closing recommendations once final policies are finalized and provided to the OIG for review.  The OIG will also track updates related to GAO and Congressional inquiries. *   **Ongoing Efforts:** The BOP is actively engaged in implementing these changes, though progress is contingent on the Union negotiation process and budgetary constraints.",

The guide emphasizes a holistic approach, considering both inmate self-report and objective observations. It includes recommendations for interventions based on the level of risk identified, such as suicide watches, therapy, and safety plans. Finally, it presents a post-suicide watch report guide, documenting the assessment process and recommendations following a watch period.",
