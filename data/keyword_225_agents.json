AUSA reviews of FBI files identified a single interview on or about August 7, 2007 with Florida FBI agents. Keyword searches of AUSA email inboxes and inquiries with Jane Doe yielded no additional interview records. Jane Doe could not recall whether she met with the FBI agents once or twice, and suggested that undocumented follow-up interviews might have occurred if new statements were made. AUSA is awaiting a response from a contact regarding SDFL’s awareness of any additional interviews.",

Neill were charged with tax offenses, moving to dismiss based on the government’s alleged invasion of their attorney-client privilege. The government opposed the motion, arguing they used “taint team” procedures to handle potentially privileged documents. The court, Judge Joyce Hens Green, ruled that while the government's use of the “taint team” constituted a per se intentional intrusion on the privilege, they successfully rebutted the presumption of harm. This was based on the government's implementation of safeguards – including having FBI agents act as Principal Legal Advisors (PLAs) – and testimony indicating the prosecution team had no access to the potentially privileged material. The court ordered the motion to dismiss denied, concluding that no constitutional violation occurred due to the government's actions.  The court further denied a motion to supplement the record. The case centered on the seizure of documents, the government's review process using the “taint team,” and the defendants’ argument that this constituted an unlawful intrusion.",

Key points include: *   **Recusal of SD Florida and ND Georgia:** The Southern District of Florida recused itself from prosecution due to an earlier decision, and the Northern District of Georgia involvement was later. *   **Protection of Attorney-Client Privilege:** Concerns are raised about the potential for attorney-client privilege to be compromised during the review of seized electronic devices. A “taint review” process is proposed, involving a team to screen for privileged materials. *   **Request for Attorney List:** The government requests a list of attorneys and firms to be provided to a taint prosecutor to further safeguard privilege. *   **Device Review Protocol:** Discussions revolve around the protocol for searching and reviewing seized electronic devices, including the need for a preliminary screen for child pornography. *   **Coordination of Item Retrieval:** There are multiple requests to coordinate the return of Epstein’s phone, cash, and other seized items, involving communication with various agents and the need for a central point of contact. *   **Preservation of Communications:** The government seeks an agreement with the defense to preserve relevant emails, texts, and voicemails to avoid potential issues with the genesis of the investigation.",

Specifically, the files are not linked to their originating devices, making it impossible to track the full scope of the collection or efficiently review the materials. Attempts to establish a system for tracking the data have been met with delays and unanswered emails. There are concerns about duplicated files and an inability to determine which items are complete versus partial. Multiple parties involved (including CART, Relativity users, and the US Attorney’s office) express frustration with the lack of organization and request a coordinated meeting to address the issues and establish a clear process for reviewing the data. The team is struggling to determine what data has been previously provided, whether files are full or partial, and what devices are associated with the data.",

Initially, difficulties arose with opening the files on the Blu-rays, leading to the procurement of new copies. The data includes VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and Blu-ray discs. Multiple individuals, including FBI agents and IT support, were involved in transferring the files to a shared network drive (\\Usa.doj.gov\\cloud\\NYS\\StAndrews\\Shared) for further analysis. There were repeated requests for assistance with opening the files, identifying the source of the data (potentially originating from the FBI and possibly involving 5G cellular networks), and converting the files for compatibility. The final goal was to consolidate all data onto the shared drive for continued investigation.",

The FBI will also provide two spreadsheets detailing all physical evidence in their custody, separated by FBI Miami and New York offices. *   **Review Process:** The defense team can review the evidence at the FBI’s Bronx warehouse, subject to a two-week notice requirement, business hours, and the presence of FBI agents and a prosecutor. They can bring digital cameras (without internet connectivity) to photograph items. *   **Technical Considerations:**  Electronic files require Cellebrite software for review of Apple devices. Metadata may or may not be recoverable from damaged devices. *   **Media Review:** The FBI anticipates providing access to all electronic media (excluding witness statements) for review at the FBI's Manhattan office within approximately three weeks. *   **Communication & Scheduling:**  The parties coordinate calls to discuss the evidence and scheduling of reviews, with the FBI initially indicating a potential review date of May 18th.",
