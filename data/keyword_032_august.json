They have subsequently produced additional discovery. *   **Defendant's Requests:** Thomas requested further information, specifically seeking the Inspector General's report, records of other BOP employees involved in similar incidents, and information related to staffing issues. *   **Legal Arguments:** The government argues that Thomas’s motion is without merit because: *   The government has fulfilled its Brady and Rule 16 discovery obligations. *   The requested records are not \"material\" to Thomas's defense and would be used to promote jury nullification. *   The government does not have possession of all relevant records from other agencies (like the BOP or SEC). *   Thomas has not presented sufficient evidence to support a selective prosecution claim. In essence, the document is the government's argument against Thomas’s attempt to obtain additional discovery, asserting that it has already provided the necessary information and that the defendant’s requests are legally unsupported and seek to unfairly influence a jury.",

This request was logged in 2019. *   **Record Production:**  The BOP produced records to the plaintiffs in phased releases, beginning in August 2020. *   **Corrections to Previous Declaration:** Christenson corrects an error in her previous declaration regarding the number of scanned visitor logs and the date of a related log entry (from July 30, 2019). *   **Further Production (October 2020):** The BOP produced an additional 351 pages of records, including attorney log books and emails, after reaching agreements with the plaintiffs regarding the handling of records from the Office of Inspector General (OIG). *   **OIG Records Review:** The BOP reviewed approximately 7,475 pages of records returned from the OIG, identifying roughly 6,898 pages as non-responsive or duplicative. 387 pages were withheld in full under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(A). *   **Updated Index:** A revised index of withheld documents (the \"Updated Index\") reduces the number of pages withheld and clarifies the application of exemptions. *   **Exemption Justifications:** The BOP justifies withholding records under Exemptions 6 (privacy of personnel and medical files), 7(A) (law enforcement records), and 7(E) (techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations), citing concerns about privacy, potential harm to individuals, and the need to protect BOP operational security.

The court ruled that the Bail Reform Act prohibits wealthy defendants from being released to “self-funded private jails” when poorer defendants would be detained. The court established a principle of equal treatment under the law, stating that a two-tiered system based on wealth is unfair. A narrow exception exists where a defendant’s wealth is the *primary* factor in determining a flight risk, but this exception was not applied in the Boustani case. The ruling is now the governing law in the Second Circuit.",

The OIG concluded that the Officer in Charge’s actions constituted a violation of BOP standards, federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1001), and MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The U.S. Attorney’s Office declined prosecution due to lack of sufficient evidence.",

Personnel documented timelines of staff responses, medical interventions, communication with various authorities (AUSA, Judge Berman, etc.), and the collection of evidence (fingerprints, photos, clothing).  The investigation involved multiple visits and interviews within the facility and at Beekman Hospital.  The institution’s operations were temporarily modified, and computer systems were secured and replaced.  The investigation continued over several days with FBI involvement, OIG oversight, and staff recall.",

      "summary": "This document is a draft investigation report by the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General into the custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. The investigation focused on discrepancies in inmate counts, particularly at 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019, where the SHU had a reported 73 inmates, while the Receiving and Discharge unit had zero. Senior Officer Specialist 6 admitted to “ghost counting” – altering count slips without a proper recount – to reflect a more favorable number of inmates. He acknowledged that he should have requested a new count, but did not. The investigation determined that he cleared the inaccurate 10:00 p.m. count, violating BOP policy, and that he continued to misreport inmate counts during subsequent counts (12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m.) despite knowing they were inaccurate. The document emphasizes the poor quality of SHU video footage and the reliance on witness statements and BOP records to assess the situation. The report includes redacted portions of the document and the official name for the document used to record an institutional count (\"Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet\").",

The investigation was initiated due to concerns about Epstein’s cellmate situation and the handling of his transfer from suicide watch. Key findings include: *   **Cellmate Requirement:** Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to his psychological observation history. *   **Inmate 3’s Transfer:** Inmate 3, Epstein’s cellmate, was transferred from the facility on August 9, 2019, leaving Epstein without a designated cellmate. *   **Failure to Notify:** The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to immediately notify a supervisor about the need for a new cellmate, violating BOP standards and SHU Post Orders. They also offered inconsistent accounts regarding notifications made to other staff. *   **Lack of Cell Searches:** The officer failed to properly document cell searches, potentially missing opportunities to assess Epstein’s needs. There were concerns about an excessive amount of linens in his cell. *   **Inaccurate Count:** The 4:00 PM SHU count on August 9, 2019, was inaccurate due to a miscount of inmates, potentially hindering the realization that Inmate 3 was no longer present. *   **Draft Status:** The document is a draft and subject to revision, emphasizing the sensitivity of the information contained within. It’s marked for limited official use and strict confidentiality.",

It details the circumstances of Epstein’s death on August 10, 2019, where he was found hanged in his cell by Material Handler Michael Thomas. Here’s a breakdown of the key findings: *   **Circumstances of Death:** Thomas discovered Epstein hanged after delivering breakfast, noting the presence of an orange string around his neck.  Emergency response was initiated, and Epstein was pronounced dead at the hospital. *   **Lack of Accountability:** The investigation revealed that Thomas and another staff member, Material Handler Thomas, had not conducted the mandatory rounds and inmate counts they were responsible for on the night of August 9th and morning of August 10th. They falsified count slips to cover their actions. *   **Falsified Records:** The OIG found that Thomas and another staff member had knowingly and willfully made false statements on BOP records, falsely claiming to have conducted rounds and counts. *   **Criminal Charges:**  Both men were subsequently indicted on conspiracy and falsification of records charges, though the charges were later dismissed due to deferred prosecution agreements. *   **Security Camera Issues:** The report highlights a history of security camera problems at the facility, contributing to the lack of oversight. Essentially, the report presents a case of negligence and intentional deception by correctional officers that led to Epstein’s death and subsequent legal action.",

There were documented instances of misplaced SENTRY transactions and errors in records, including inaccurate inmate counts and missing documentation like intake screenings and 30-day psychology reviews.  On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell, prompting a medical emergency and ultimately his death. The investigation into the incident was inconclusive. The review highlighted significant failures in basic correctional practices, including incomplete inmate counts, inconsistent documentation, and failures to adhere to established suicide prevention protocols. Recommendations were made regarding staff training, institutional processes, and oversight. The estimated cost associated with the incident was approximately $10,741.60.",

McColley claimed she contacted the FBI after Epstein’s arrest but received no response.  A search of NYO records revealed no record of Alsharif or McColley contacting the FBI after Epstein's arrest.

The court found that Maxwell’s argument, centered on her subsequent indictment and arrest, was raised too late and did not meet the criteria for a motion for reconsideration (lack of intervening law, new evidence, or a clear error). The court ordered a two-day stay of the unsealing process to allow Maxwell to seek appellate review, with a final unsealing date of August 3, 2020.",

Russell Capone, counsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney, asserts that releasing these records – specifically those withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(A) – would likely interfere with ongoing criminal prosecutions involving Epstein and the individuals involved. The declaration focuses on four key categories of withheld records: inmate counts, staffing records, psychological notes, and BOP logs from August 9-10, 2019. Capone argues that disclosing these records, particularly in their entirety, could unduly influence witnesses’ testimony at trial, skew potential jurors’ perceptions, and exacerbate media speculation surrounding Epstein’s death. He contends that this interference is heightened by the ongoing Noel and Tartaglione prosecutions and the potential relevance of the information to a penalty phase in the Tartaglione case.  Ultimately, Capone argues that the records should remain withheld in their entirety to protect the integrity of the legal proceedings.",

      "summary": "Ghislaine Maxwell* case (20 Cr. 330). Specifically, she seeks to allow her to refer to and file under seal in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* (15-cv-5433) and Second Circuit appeal (No. 20-2413) certain discovery materials produced by the government, primarily from August 5, 2020, and a large batch from Boies Schiller & Flexner. The request stems from a need for fair determination of key issues impacting her privacy and due process rights. Maxwell argues that the government has essentially turned over all discovery materials produced in both the *Giuffre* and Jane Doe 43 cases. She believes this has been done secretly, in conjunction with Boies Schiller, and that this information was not fully disclosed to her. Maxwell asserts that the government's actions violate the Protective Order, which exempts information obtained “from a source other than the government,” and that she’s acting out of “abundance of caution.” She highlights a conflict between the government’s actions and a court order that the government must comply with when producing documents. The motion further argues that the unsealing of these materials is justified because the documents are “judicial documents” with a presumptive right of public access and that the government’s interference with the process is unfair. The motion also points to an emergency stay of unsealing ordered by the Second Circuit pending briefing. Finally, the document contends the court should allow her to use the materials under seal for her defense in the ongoing legal proceedings.",

The court found Maxwell’s arguments speculative and lacking a clear explanation of why the documents were needed in the civil cases.  The court ruled that much of the information she sought was already publicly available through government filings. Ultimately, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer on proposed redactions to Maxwell’s August 17th letter motion, with a deadline of September 4, 2020, to submit their proposals.

Initially, the Court addressed a “Curcio issue” – a confidential matter involving counsel for Mr. Tartaglione, Ms. Sternheim. The primary focus shifted to the government’s request to seal letters regarding prison conditions, prison designation, and Mr. Tartaglione’s housing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) and Medium Medium Correctional Facility (MDC). The government sought to seal letters dated August 23rd and 28th, arguing it protected BOP’s deliberative process and prevented inmates from manipulating housing assignments. The Court ultimately ruled that the letters *were* judicial documents due to their relevance to Mr. Tartaglione’s trial rights and the court’s oversight. The Court then rejected the government's argument to maintain the seal, ordering its unsealing due to a lack of demonstrated compelling interest and concerns about potential manipulation of security protocols. Finally, the court addressed concerns about a telephone seized from Mr. Tartaglione, and the government abandoned the effort to obtain a warrant for it. Counsel proposed a timeline for trial scheduling, pending further discussion with the government.",
