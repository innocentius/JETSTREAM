Maxwell* (15-cv-5433) and Second Circuit appeal (No. 20-2413) certain discovery materials produced by the government, primarily from August 5, 2020, and a large batch from Boies Schiller & Flexner. The request stems from a need for fair determination of key issues impacting her privacy and due process rights. Maxwell argues that the government has essentially turned over all discovery materials produced in both the *Giuffre* and Jane Doe 43 cases. She believes this has been done secretly, in conjunction with Boies Schiller, and that this information was not fully disclosed to her. Maxwell asserts that the government's actions violate the Protective Order, which exempts information obtained “from a source other than the government,” and that she’s acting out of “abundance of caution.” She highlights a conflict between the government’s actions and a court order that the government must comply with when producing documents. The motion further argues that the unsealing of these materials is justified because the documents are “judicial documents” with a presumptive right of public access and that the government’s interference with the process is unfair. The motion also points to an emergency stay of unsealing ordered by the Second Circuit pending briefing. Finally, the document contends the court should allow her to use the materials under seal for her defense in the ongoing legal proceedings.",

Specifically, some materials are designated as \"highly confidential\" due to containing sexually explicit images. The materials are available for pickup at the U.S. Attorney's office and the FBI New York office, with a process for producing electronic copies of certain files. The government clarifies that it will not directly provide these highly confidential materials to the defendant and notes the existence of a separate FBI file unrelated to the case, which will not be produced.",

The team highlights the government's repeated public statements regarding the ongoing investigation and contends that the materials are judicial documents with no sensitive victim information. They assert the government hasn’t established a sufficient countervailing interest to justify continued sealing, particularly given the potential for future motion practice and the desire to protect her right to a fair trial.",

      "summary": "Department of Justice (Southern District of New York) to a discovery request filed by defense counsel in the case of *United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell* (20 Cr. 330). The request includes 22 specific requests, a general Brady and Giglio request, and 10 “specific Brady requests” for discovery, inspection, and copying of materials. The DOJ asserts its commitment to full disclosure obligations under Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio, stating they intend to comply regardless of specific requests. They argue that many of the requested items are inherently related to Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 3500 (3500 material) or Giglio material. The DOJ outlines a standard practice in their district – producing Giglio and Jencks Act materials shortly before trial – and indicates they intend to begin producing 3500 material closer to trial. They propose to produce witness statements 4-8 weeks before trial, a practice widely held as sufficient to meet Giglio requirements. The DOJ rejects several specific requests, primarily citing Rule 16 protections and the established practice of producing Giglio and Jencks Act materials near trial. They specifically deny immediate disclosure of Giglio material and assertions of co-conspirator identity. They are unwilling to provide information related to the NPA, Grand Jury proceedings, or specific witness communications, arguing it is not within their discovery obligations and that such disclosures are typically not exculpatory. The DOJ is open to discussing a schedule for pretrial disclosures and explicitly requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses she intends to call, reiterating the reciprocity of discovery under Rule 16(b).",

The FBI is prepared to allow defense counsel and Maxwell to review these images on multiple occasions. 4.  **Conditions of Confinement:** The government has consulted with MDC legal counsel regarding Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. They have addressed concerns regarding: *   Access to discovery time (up to 13 hours daily). *   Body scans (weekly). *   Commissary access (including sports bras and supplemental food). *   Meal provision (with detailed tracking and ensured freshness). *   Mail procedures (following BOP regulations). 5.  **Ongoing Efforts:** The government states it will continue to work with defense counsel and the MDC to address any further issues related to discovery access and confinement conditions.",

Ghislaine Maxwell*. The government denies the request, asserting that it has provided the defendant with sufficient information to prepare for trial and prevent surprise. Specifically, the government highlights the detailed speaking superseding indictment and over 2.7 million items of discovery (electronic form) that the defendant has already received. The government argues that a bill of particulars is not required when the indictment clearly outlines the charges and the defendant has received adequate notice through discovery. They cite several previous court rulings that prohibit using a bill of particulars to: *   Acquire evidentiary details. *   Serve as a general investigative tool. *   Allow a defendant to preview the government's case or trial strategy. The government maintains that the indictment, coupled with the extensive discovery, provides the defendant with ample information regarding the allegations and supporting evidence, and that requests for specific details regarding witnesses or co-conspirators are inappropriate. They reiterate their willingness to cooperate regarding pretrial disclosures.",

Ghislaine Maxwell). The core of the response is a critique of the government’s approach, arguing it’s designed to secure a conviction regardless of the truth. Specifically, the response addresses three key items: *   **The Journal:** The government seeks to use Accuser-2’s diary to bolster its case, but the attorneys argue the government is selectively using portions, ignoring the rest, and relying on biased sources (BSF lawyers). They highlight the lack of access to the entire journal and the government’s unfounded claims about its contents. *   **The Boots & Photographs:** The government’s actions regarding these items – seizing them, then claiming to make them available – are viewed as interference with Maxwell’s defense. The attorneys express concerns about the quality of photocopies and the government’s unwillingness to provide full access to original materials, citing potential manipulation. *   **Overall Argument:** The document asserts that the government is unfairly suppressing evidence, applying a biased approach, and attempting to influence the trial’s outcome. It invokes legal principles like Rule 16 (discovery rights) and Rule 612 (refreshing witness testimony) to demand full disclosure and a fair process, emphasizing the government’s focus on conviction rather than truth-finding.",

William Henry Cosby Jr.*. The Cosby case involved a District Attorney reneging on a promise not to prosecute Cosby for sexual assault, leading to the vacated conviction. The letter argues Maxwell’s situation mirrors this, highlighting the NPA as a formal agreement, and requesting the court to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment.",

Darren It Indyke, et al.) pending the resolution of Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal prosecution (United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell). The government argues this is necessary to protect the integrity of the criminal case, conserve resources, and prevent Maxwell from asserting her Fifth Amendment rights through depositions.  Several plaintiffs have filed similar civil suits, and this case is the only active one remaining. The government believes allowing the civil case to proceed would prejudice the criminal trial by potentially influencing witness testimony and expanding discovery. They cite a five-factor test for stays, prioritizing the criminal case’s interests.  Specifically, they are concerned Maxwell might avoid depositions to protect herself, and that premature discovery could impact the criminal prosecution. The government seeks a full stay until the conclusion of Maxwell’s criminal trial scheduled for July 12, 2021.",

The reason is that his expected testimony about prosecutorial misconduct is irrelevant to the core issue of Ms. Maxwell’s guilt. *   **Rule 16 Compliance:** The defense’s disclosure of expert witnesses has not met the requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, which demands a summary of the witnesses’ opinions, bases, and qualifications. *   **Prejudice Concerns:** The court’s decision is partly based on the potential for confusion and prejudice to the jury if Gershman’s testimony were admitted. Essentially, the court is exercising its discretion to limit expert testimony to ensure a fair trial and prevent the introduction of irrelevant or prejudicial information.",

The primary dispute centers around the trial start date, with the defense (Sternheim’s office) strongly advocating for November 8, 2021, due to concerns about continuity of counsel, potential witness unavailability, and the disruptive impact of a later trial on Maxwell’s health and holiday plans.  The prosecution (represented by Laura Menninger and Jeff Pagliuca) initially proposed November 29, 2021, but later suggested November 15th as a compromise.  The defense emphasized the need for a speedy trial and raised concerns about the government’s failure to provide specifics justifying the preferred date.  Scheduling conflicts related to Laura Menninger’s other trial and the need to review 3500 material were also discussed, with the defense linking these to the request for a speedy trial.  A key point of contention is the potential exclusion of Speedy Trial Act time, which the defense opposes unless Ms. Maxwell is released on bail. Communication primarily occurred through email, with a focus on establishing a trial date by the end of the year.",

The Defense initially moved to exclude Dr. Rocchio’s testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and the Daubert standard. **Key Points:** *   **Daubert Standard:** The court applied the Daubert standard, which requires expert testimony to be based on reliable principles and methods, tested, and subject to peer review, and to assist the trier of fact. *   **Initial Ruling:** The court initially intended to grant the Defense’s motion, but ultimately decided to deny it in part. *   **Admissible Opinions:** Dr. Rocchio’s core opinions – that perpetrators of sexual abuse often use grooming tactics, manipulation, and coercion, and that abuse can cause long-term psychological harm – are deemed admissible. These opinions are supported by her qualifications (PhD in clinical psychology), extensive experience, and published work. *   **Excluded Opinion:** The court excluded Dr. Rocchio’s opinion regarding the facilitation of sexual abuse by a third party (\"grooming by proxy\"), citing a lack of peer review and a deviation from established principles. *   **Relevance and Prejudice:** The court determined that the remaining opinions are relevant to the case and that the potential prejudice is limited. *   **Timely Disclosure:** The government’s supplemental expert witness disclosures were deemed timely and therefore admissible.",
