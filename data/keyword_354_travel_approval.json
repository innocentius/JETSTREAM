The Criminal Investigative Crimes Against Children Unit (CACU) approved the Miami Division’s request.  The advisory outlines specific procedures including: submitting an Electronic Clearance (EC) to the Legat office in Canberra, Australia; completing an Electronic Country Clearance (eCC) through the Department of State; and submitting a Clearance Passage Worksheet.  All submissions must be unclassified except for sensitive information which should be handled securely. Coordination with the Legat office and the Office of International Operations (OIO) is critical for securing Country Clearances.",
