Berman, criticized the conditions at New York City’s federal jails, specifically the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) and Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), citing issues including unsanitary conditions, drug activity, violence, and inadequate responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. He expressed disappointment that U.S. Attorney General William Barr had not conducted a thorough investigation, referencing concerns raised by an April 30 report by epidemiologist Homer Venters detailing deficiencies in medical care and protocol at the MDC. The judge’s comments occurred during the sentencing of Terrance Morgan for bank fraud conspiracy, and he indicated that the conditions influenced his decision to sentence Morgan to time served, home confinement, and supervised release. The case is linked to a previous lawsuit regarding attorneys’ access to clients at the MDC and is currently in mediation.",

Specifically, they are seeking: 1.  **Disclosure of Victim Identities:** The government must disclose the identities of the three alleged victims (Victims 1-3) referenced in the indictment to the defense, subject to the protective order. They argue this is crucial for a fair trial, given the timeframe of the alleged offenses and the complexity of the case. They highlight the government's delayed disclosure and the resulting inability to conduct a meaningful investigation. 2.  **Improved Conditions of Confinement & Discovery Access:** The team argues Maxwell's treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) is unduly harsh, a reaction to Jeffrey Epstein’s death, and negatively impacting her ability to prepare her defense. They request increased access to a computer terminal to review discovery materials, arguing the current limitations are inadequate given the volume of discovery expected. They seek to be treated similarly to other pretrial detainees and to have sufficient time to fully analyze the discovery materials.",

The DOJ asserts that it has fulfilled its discovery obligations, including producing electronic materials and initial non-electronic discovery by the deadlines set by the court.  The DOJ acknowledges delays in providing discovery to Maxwell due to defense requests for reformatting and rebinding, but claims these were addressed promptly. They highlight efforts to ensure Maxwell could access discovery at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), including creating new files, coordinating with MDC IT staff, and temporarily allowing defense counsel to bring laptops.  Specifically, the DOJ is facilitating the review of approximately 43,500 images seized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences, and is working to address concerns about her conditions of confinement, such as access to meals, medical care, and mail, while acknowledging limitations due to the pandemic and BOP regulations. The Government confirmed she will receive up to 13 hours of discovery access per day, exceeding that of other MDC inmates.",

The primary points are: 1.  **Discovery Obligations Met:** The government asserts it has fulfilled its discovery obligations, including the production of electronic materials and initial non-electronic discovery, despite earlier assertions to the contrary. The deadline for electronic discovery was November 9, 2020, and initial discovery was due August 21, 2020. 2.  **Addressing Access at MDC:** The government has taken steps to ensure Maxwell can access discovery materials at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), including: *   Creating new copies of files in accessible formats upon notification of issues. *   Working with MDC IT to resolve technical difficulties. *   Arranging for MDC staff to adjust the table for note-taking. *   Providing a privacy screen. *   Allowing defense counsel to bring a laptop for review. 3.  **Highly Confidential Material Access:** The government is facilitating the review of approximately 43,500 images seized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences, initially loading them onto a secure laptop. The FBI is prepared to allow defense counsel and Maxwell to review these images on multiple occasions. 4.  **Conditions of Confinement:** The government has consulted with MDC legal counsel regarding Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. They have addressed concerns regarding: *   Access to discovery time (up to 13 hours daily). *   Body scans (weekly). *   Commissary access (including sports bras and supplemental food). *   Meal provision (with detailed tracking and ensured freshness). *   Mail procedures (following BOP regulations). 5.  **Ongoing Efforts:** The government states it will continue to work with defense counsel and the MDC to address any further issues related to discovery access and confinement conditions.",

Due to the high volume of inmates (1,700) and the legal department's responsibilities, expedited delivery for Maxwell’s mail is not practicable. A hard drive containing court disclosures was delivered via FedEx on October 11, 2021, but a subsequent institutional emergency delayed delivery on October 13, 2021, which was personally delivered by legal counsel on October 14, 2021. The court rejected Maxwell’s request for a specific delivery order, but expects mail to be delivered within one business day going forward.",
