Dershowitz argued the conflict was “severe” and that Boies Schiller’s representation created a situation where they could be accused of bias. Boies Schiller’s counsel urged the court to deny the motion without further briefing, arguing Dershowitz failed to comply with court rules and the motion was “tactical.” The case involves allegations of sexual abuse and human trafficking involving Jeffrey Epstein and multiple underage girls.",

The agency is actively monitoring his movements, and a search warrant was executed.  The file outlines a tactical briefing and further preparations for the arrest.  It indicates that Epstein was out of the country at the time, and that a plan for capturing him once he returned was in place.",

Judge Katherine Polk Failla presided over the meeting, attended by attorneys from Kaplan Hecker & Fink (representing the plaintiffs) and Troutman Sanders LLP (representing the estate’s executors). The primary focus of the conference was a motion filed by the plaintiffs to dismiss punitive damages claims against the estate. The estate’s attorneys, Bennet Moskowitz and Charles Glover, proposed establishing a fund to settle claims, arguing that the plaintiffs were not fully engaged with this process. There was a disagreement over the scope of discovery, with the plaintiffs advocating for a more thorough investigation and the estate arguing for a more limited approach. Key points of contention included: the lack of a defined amount for the settlement fund, the plaintiffs’ skepticism towards the settlement process, and the applicability of New York law versus Virgin Islands law regarding punitive damages. The plaintiffs argued for dismissing punitive damages based on New York statute, while the estate maintained that its lawyers were exploring different jurisdictions for potential claims.  Ultimately, the judge did not immediately schedule a briefing on the motion but requested further communication and a discussion about the claims administration process.",

Maxwell* (15-cv-5433) and Second Circuit appeal (No. 20-2413) certain discovery materials produced by the government, primarily from August 5, 2020, and a large batch from Boies Schiller & Flexner. The request stems from a need for fair determination of key issues impacting her privacy and due process rights. Maxwell argues that the government has essentially turned over all discovery materials produced in both the *Giuffre* and Jane Doe 43 cases. She believes this has been done secretly, in conjunction with Boies Schiller, and that this information was not fully disclosed to her. Maxwell asserts that the government's actions violate the Protective Order, which exempts information obtained “from a source other than the government,” and that she’s acting out of “abundance of caution.” She highlights a conflict between the government’s actions and a court order that the government must comply with when producing documents. The motion further argues that the unsealing of these materials is justified because the documents are “judicial documents” with a presumptive right of public access and that the government’s interference with the process is unfair. The motion also points to an emergency stay of unsealing ordered by the Second Circuit pending briefing. Finally, the document contends the court should allow her to use the materials under seal for her defense in the ongoing legal proceedings.",

Counsel seeks a temporary three-week stay of the unsealing process to allow for consultation with the U.S. Attorney's Office and a potential modification of the protective order. They propose streamlining the unsealing process through modifications to the protocol, including reduced briefing page limits and a shorter objection response period.
