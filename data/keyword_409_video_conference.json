The initial purpose is to gather information about the client’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.  Jill Greenfield, a partner at Fieldfisher, is facilitating the communication. Initially, a video conference via BlueJeans is proposed.  The U.S. Attorney wants to discuss the client’s general employment and experiences with Epstein, emphasizing a voluntary and sensitive approach, with no requirement to discuss abuse specifics. Concerns are raised about the client’s anonymity and the potential for discussing sensitive topics.  The U.S. Attorney seeks clarification on who would be in the meeting, access to notes, and the handling of the client's anonymity, prompting discussions about the team’s composition, note-taking procedures, and the protection of the client’s identity. A proposed meeting in London is suggested, but logistical challenges related to international travel (specifically the coronavirus pandemic) are quickly identified, leading to a shift towards a phone call.",

Rivera is housed in the general population at the MCC. *   **Court Orders:** Both defendants have court-ordered access to technology, but the MCC’s implementation of these orders differs significantly. *   **Legal Arguments:** Defense counsel argues the disparity is due to race, gender, and class, raising concerns about potential bias. *   **Declaration Request:** The US Attorney’s office is preparing a declaration from the BOP to justify the differing treatment. *   **Timeline:** The deadline for the BOP declaration is December 31, 2020.",
