      "summary": "Jay Lefkowitz proposed edits to a paragraph within a Non-Prosecution Agreement regarding the selection of an attorney representative for victims. The original paragraph outlined the U.S.'s right to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, subject to Epstein’s counsel’s approval. Lefkowitz suggested modifying it to state the U.S. “will assign” the responsibility, aiming for a judge (like Davis) to select the attorney. He also clarified that Epstein would pay the attorney’s fees but not costs of contested litigation. The Addendum was subsequently agreed upon by Jeffrey Epstein, Alexander Acosta, and legal counsel, solidifying these changes to the Non-Prosecution Agreement.",

Key points include: *   **Multiple Confirmations:** Several individuals repeatedly confirm the same person, often correcting previous discrepancies in contact information. *   **Missing Contact Information:** There are 13 victims with no contact information and several with questions about contacting them. *   **Distribution Plans:** Discussions center on how to distribute the invitations – primarily via email, though paper copies are also involved – and coordinating with legal counsel (Bob Josefverg and Robert Glassman). *   **Document Revisions:** Multiple versions of the invitation letter and RSVP questionnaire are circulated, with edits and approvals documented by various FBI personnel. *   **Logistical Details:** Questions arise regarding the timeline for sending out the invitations, parking arrangements, and the need for OPA review during the clearance process. *   **Ongoing Coordination:**  The document represents an ongoing effort to gather and verify contact information and to prepare the invitation materials for distribution to victims and their attorneys.",
