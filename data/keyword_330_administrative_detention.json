Key events include: *   **Initial Counts:** The log begins with initial counts of 756 inmates, with varying numbers in Special Housing Units (SHU). *   **Operational Issues:** Frequent reports of system malfunctions, particularly with the Public Address System, lead to delays in announcements and procedures. *   **Inmate Management:** Several inmates are placed on suicide watch, requiring companion assignments and administrative detention. *   **Security Procedures:** Regular counts, metal detector checks, restraint equipment inventories, and roof checks are conducted. *   **Phone Monitoring:** STG and High Alert phone calls are monitored, with no WITSEC inquiries received during the shift. *   **Shift Changes:** The Lieutenant transitions between morning, day, and evening shifts, each with specific duties and observations. The log consistently records counts, inmate movements, and operational issues encountered throughout the shifts.",
