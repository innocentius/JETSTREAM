Key events include: *   **Initial Counts:** The log begins with initial counts of 756 inmates, with varying numbers in Special Housing Units (SHU). *   **Operational Issues:** Frequent reports of system malfunctions, particularly with the Public Address System, lead to delays in announcements and procedures. *   **Inmate Management:** Several inmates are placed on suicide watch, requiring companion assignments and administrative detention. *   **Security Procedures:** Regular counts, metal detector checks, restraint equipment inventories, and roof checks are conducted. *   **Phone Monitoring:** STG and High Alert phone calls are monitored, with no WITSEC inquiries received during the shift. *   **Shift Changes:** The Lieutenant transitions between morning, day, and evening shifts, each with specific duties and observations. The log consistently records counts, inmate movements, and operational issues encountered throughout the shifts.",

M. reported hearing a medical call, discovering Epstein’s body, and learning that Epstein’s cellmate had left without one. Multiple officers admitted to errors in counts and failing to reassigned Epstein a cellmate. E. was unaware of camera malfunctions and cellmate movement. M. relayed instructions to lieutenants regarding Epstein needing a cellmate, but several officers were unavailable for interviews due to union representatives. Attempts to interview MI and another officer who discovered Epstein were unsuccessful. Video evidence analysis is ongoing.",
