Key points from the declaration: *   **Background:** Christenson works at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota, and her previous declaration details her role. *   **FOIA Requests:** The BOP received a separate FOIA request (not from the plaintiffs) for MCC video records in August 2019. This request was logged in 2019. *   **Record Production:**  The BOP produced records to the plaintiffs in phased releases, beginning in August 2020. *   **Corrections to Previous Declaration:** Christenson corrects an error in her previous declaration regarding the number of scanned visitor logs and the date of a related log entry (from July 30, 2019). *   **Further Production (October 2020):** The BOP produced an additional 351 pages of records, including attorney log books and emails, after reaching agreements with the plaintiffs regarding the handling of records from the Office of Inspector General (OIG). *   **OIG Records Review:** The BOP reviewed approximately 7,475 pages of records returned from the OIG, identifying roughly 6,898 pages as non-responsive or duplicative. 387 pages were withheld in full under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(A). *   **Updated Index:** A revised index of withheld documents (the \"Updated Index\") reduces the number of pages withheld and clarifies the application of exemptions. *   **Exemption Justifications:** The BOP justifies withholding records under Exemptions 6 (privacy of personnel and medical files), 7(A) (law enforcement records), and 7(E) (techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations), citing concerns about privacy, potential harm to individuals, and the need to protect BOP operational security. Specifically, they argue that releasing certain information would risk compromising investigations or endangering BOP employees and inmates.",

      "summary": "This document is a draft investigation report by the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General into the custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. The investigation focused on discrepancies in inmate counts, particularly at 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019, where the SHU had a reported 73 inmates, while the Receiving and Discharge unit had zero. Senior Officer Specialist 6 admitted to “ghost counting” – altering count slips without a proper recount – to reflect a more favorable number of inmates. He acknowledged that he should have requested a new count, but did not. The investigation determined that he cleared the inaccurate 10:00 p.m. count, violating BOP policy, and that he continued to misreport inmate counts during subsequent counts (12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m.) despite knowing they were inaccurate. The document emphasizes the poor quality of SHU video footage and the reliance on witness statements and BOP records to assess the situation. The report includes redacted portions of the document and the official name for the document used to record an institutional count (\"Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet\").",

Srebnick, P.A., requested the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York to investigate David Boies and John Stanley Pottinger’s alleged scheme. This scheme involved Boies and Pottinger attempting to purchase videos of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged criminal activity from Patrick Kessler with the intent of securing payoffs from the wealthy men depicted in the videos. The New York Times reported on this activity, and subsequent television coverage confirmed the details. The request argues that Boies’s conduct constitutes conspiracy to commit extortion and potentially violates other criminal statutes. The lawyers also suggest that Boies’s testimony regarding this scheme may be influenced by a desire to curry favor with the government, given his importance to the firm’s financial success. Srebnick demands evidence relating to Boies's conduct and whether he is under federal investigation.",

      "summary": "The request is for the United States District Court to hold an evidentiary hearing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the loss of video surveillance footage from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) that allegedly captured the events of July 22-23, 2019, when Epstein attempted suicide in Tartaglione’s cell. Specifically, the defense argues: *   The footage would have been exculpatory, corroborating Tartaglione’s account of events. *   The Government’s explanation for the footage’s destruction is inadequate, lacking specificity and sworn testimony. *   The BOP, which held exclusive control of the footage, failed to preserve it despite a clear preservation request. *   The loss of the footage potentially impacts the punishment phase of a capital case, as it contains mitigating evidence related to Tartaglione’s actions. The defense seeks answers to questions about who destroyed the footage, the chain of responsibility, whether witnesses reviewed it, and whether the destruction was deliberate or due to negligence. They believe the loss constitutes a deprivation of a constitutional right to present mitigating evidence and is “chargeable to the state.”",

The U.S. Attorney wants to discuss the client’s general employment and experiences with Epstein, emphasizing a voluntary and sensitive approach, with no requirement to discuss abuse specifics. Concerns are raised about the client’s anonymity and the potential for discussing sensitive topics.  The U.S. Attorney seeks clarification on who would be in the meeting, access to notes, and the handling of the client's anonymity, prompting discussions about the team’s composition, note-taking procedures, and the protection of the client’s identity. A proposed meeting in London is suggested, but logistical challenges related to international travel (specifically the coronavirus pandemic) are quickly identified, leading to a shift towards a phone call.",

A COVID-19 outbreak led to a 14-day quarantine for Maxwell, during which she was permitted standard quarantine privileges (cell, daily checks, limited access, and use of a laptop for discovery review - 13 hours daily). *   **Continued Updates (December 4, 2020 & January 15, 2021):** The Government continued to report on Maxwell’s conditions, emphasizing consistent access to discovery (13 hours daily, seven days a week across both a desktop and laptop), regular video-teleconference calls with her attorneys (five hours per weekday), and the continuation of standard MDC procedures including searches, food service, and water provision. The government’s legal counsel noted that MDC staff monitored Maxwell’s health and weight.  The MDC legal team responded to concerns raised by defense counsel regarding access to the laptop and in-person visits, but without reaching an agreement. *   **Court Order (January 25, 2021):**  Judge Nathan ordered the Government to provide 60-day written updates regarding Maxwell’s confinement, focusing on access to legal materials and searches.  The Court denied the BOP’s request to compel Warden Tellez to appear and respond directly. *   **Final Update (February 4, 2021):** The Government provided a detailed response to the Judge's January order, reinforcing that Maxwell continues to receive the maximum permitted access to discovery and legal communications, detailing standard MDC procedures (including searches, healthcare, and water provision), and addressing previous concerns regarding monitoring and surveillance. The government also reported on the defendant's recent COVID-19 vaccination status.",

They also raise concerns about potential bias based on race, gender, and class. *   **The Request:** The United States Attorney’s Office is preparing a declaration from the BOP to justify the differing treatment, outlining the reasons for Maxwell's enhanced access. *   **Timeline:** The declaration is due by December 31st, and the attorneys are coordinating to identify a suitable declarant and draft the explanation.",

The US Attorney’s Office is preparing a declaration for Judge Engelmayer explaining why the accommodations provided to Maxwell at the MDC – specifically 13 hours daily laptop access and 15 hours of videoconference meetings – cannot be extended to Rivera at the MCC. The key difference cited is their vastly different housing situations: Maxwell is in protective custody outside the general population with significantly more access, while Rivera is in the general population with limited access. The judge expressed concern about the disparity, suggesting it appeared racially motivated. The team is working to finalize the declaration by December 31st, aiming to explain the rationale behind the differing treatment to the court.",

Rivera is housed in the general population at the MCC. *   **Court Orders:** Both defendants have court-ordered access to technology, but the MCC’s implementation of these orders differs significantly. *   **Legal Arguments:** Defense counsel argues the disparity is due to race, gender, and class, raising concerns about potential bias. *   **Declaration Request:** The US Attorney’s office is preparing a declaration from the BOP to justify the differing treatment. *   **Timeline:** The deadline for the BOP declaration is December 31, 2020.",

Rivera’s access to his laptop and increased video calls with counsel are being significantly restricted. **Key Points:** *   **Laptop Access:** Rivera initially received his laptop in the SHU, but access was abruptly denied after a transfer due to staff’s unawareness of the Judge’s order. Subsequent access was intermittent and dependent on daily reports, often hampered by staff concerns and discomfort, including concerning remarks about Rivera being an “enemy #1.” *   **Increased Video Calls:** Rivera’s legal team requested two 2-hour video calls per week, citing limitations imposed by the MCC and the need for effective preparation for his trial (scheduled to begin February 16, 2021). This request was repeatedly denied by the MCC, who offered only a single 4-hour session, despite the Court's order. *   **Concerns Regarding Conditions:** The legal team expresses serious concerns about Rivera’s conditions of confinement, including hostile staff behavior, limited access to counsel, and the stressful environment. They note the disparity in treatment compared to Ghislaine Maxwell, who enjoys significantly greater access to discovery and counsel. *   **COVID-19 Impact:** The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak at the MCC is cited as a reason for restricted movement and access, further complicating Rivera's situation. *   **Lack of Response:** Despite the Court’s orders, the MCC is not fulfilling the requested accommodations, creating further obstacles to Rivera's legal defense.",

The BOP has completed a review and offers an update on its plans to address six recommendations made by the OIG. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: *   **Overall Approach:** The BOP is revising Program Statements (5321.09, 5324.08, 5500.14, 5500.15, 4200.12) to comply with the OIG’s recommendations. These revisions require adherence to the standard BOP policy development and Union negotiation processes, meaning changes are subject to modification. *   **Specific Recommendations & Responses:** *   **Cellmate Assignment:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5321.09 to establish a process for assigning cellmates after suicide watch, with exceptions considered. *   **Continued Cellmate Placement:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5321.09 to ensure inmates at high risk remain with a cellmate until recommendations are changed. *   **Social/Legal Visit Approvals:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5324.08 to standardize the process for obtaining approvals for social/legal visits for inmates on suicide watch. *   **Inmate Wellbeing Accounting:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5500.14 to improve accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. *   **Lieutenant Round Procedures:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5500.14 to clarify Lieutenant procedures during rounds. *   **Staffing Shortages:** The BOP is analyzing staffing incentives and reducing incentive spending due to budget constraints. They are also exploring funding options for a nationwide special salary rate. *   **Security Camera Systems:** The BOP is revising Program Statements 5500.15 and 4200.12 to mandate video recording capacity and regular system functionality checks. *   **OIG Monitoring:** The OIG will continue to monitor the BOP’s progress and consider closing recommendations once final policies are finalized and provided to the OIG for review.  The OIG will also track updates related to GAO and Congressional inquiries. *   **Ongoing Efforts:** The BOP is actively engaged in implementing these changes, though progress is contingent on the Union negotiation process and budgetary constraints.",
