      "summary": "This document is a daily log of a Lieutenant’s shift at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, covering Saturday, July 13, 2019. The log details routine activities including counts, inventory checks, security procedures (metal detectors, alarm testing), inmate observations (psychological, suicide watch), and administrative actions (detentions, furloughs). There were multiple inmate counts throughout the day, disruptions due to system malfunctions, and monitoring of STG and High Alert phone calls. A notable event was a furlough to a Housing Area (HA) and a temporary chit inventory was conducted. The log records the shift change and the final count of 798 inmates.",
