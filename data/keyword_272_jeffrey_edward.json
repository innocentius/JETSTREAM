      "summary": "Jeffrey Edward Epstein (born 01/20/1953), a Black male inmate at MCC-NY, was assessed on 07/08/2019 due to a recent arrival. He is incarcerated for sex trafficking and previously incarcerated for prostitution. He denies a history of mental health treatment or symptoms, including suicidal ideation.  His psychosocial history includes a single status, high school education, and prior banking employment. Initial assessment revealed \"Other\" psychosocial issues and a calm, cooperative demeanor.  He was categorized as CARE1-MH (low risk), indicating no significant functional impairment.  Risk of sexual abusiveness was identified due to a history of sexual predation and violent offenses, leading to recommendations for continued monitoring and potentially specialized programming. A general administrative note highlighted heightened suicide risk concerns due to his legal situation and mandated immediate notification to psychology staff upon his return from court.",

Subsequent entries (07/28-07/31) documented ongoing observation, including issues with sleep, numbness, a concerning incident with a toilet, and questions about his accommodations. The prison psychologist provided supportive interventions and coping strategies, including handouts and educating him on procedures.  A suicide risk assessment was conducted on 07/23/2019 (and repeated on 08/01/2019), finding a low overall risk with protective factors present. A final assessment on 08/08/2019 noted his general well-being and continued monitoring with weekly rounds and monthly SHU reviews.  He was initially flagged due to a concern about a string around his neck, but the source of the marks remains unclear.",

He presented with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and a history of sleep apnea (using a CPAP machine). He reported severe lower extremity pain, likely caused by spinal stenosis, and had been taking Medrol for this.  He also had a history of triglyceride elevations for which he discontinued Vascepa due to side effects.  During the encounter, physical exams revealed normal findings except for the pain, obesity, and abnormalities in his back. The provider ordered magnesium hydroxide for constipation, methylprednisolone for neuralgia, and continued existing medications. Subsequent encounters (July 7 and 9, 2019) involved further laboratory testing (including A1C, lipid profile, CMP, and urinalysis) and continued monitoring of his conditions, plus documentation of patient education.  The encounter concluded with no specific changes to his medications, except for the addition of magnesium hydroxide, and scheduled follow-up appointments.",
