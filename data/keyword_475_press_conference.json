      "summary": "*   **Initial Investigations (2005-2007):** The FBI and West Palm Beach Police investigated Epstein starting in 2005, involving interviews with approximately 35 victims, a search of his Florida residence, and analysis of records. *   **Non-Prosecution Agreement (2008):** Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution and received a 18-month sentence, a deal that drew significant media attention due to Alex Acosta's involvement. *   **New York Investigation (2018):** The SDNY opened an investigation into Epstein’s activities in New York, confirmed by his long-standing connections and residence there. *   **Victim Accounts:** Victims, primarily between ages 14-17, reported Epstein’s abuse involving masturbation, fondling, and direct genital contact, with payments of $200-$300 per session. He recruited additional girls through recruiters. Locations included New York City, Florida, USVI, and New Mexico. *   **Ongoing Efforts:** The NYO is coordinating interviews with co-conspirators and victims, pursuing seizure of Epstein’s residences (valued at approximately $100M), and planning a press conference with a victim tip line.",
