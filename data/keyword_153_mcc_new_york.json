The OIG concluded that the Officer in Charge’s actions constituted a violation of BOP standards, federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1001), and MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The U.S. Attorney’s Office declined prosecution due to lack of sufficient evidence.",

Here’s a breakdown of the key findings: *   **Circumstances of Death:** Thomas discovered Epstein hanged after delivering breakfast, noting the presence of an orange string around his neck.  Emergency response was initiated, and Epstein was pronounced dead at the hospital. *   **Lack of Accountability:** The investigation revealed that Thomas and another staff member, Material Handler Thomas, had not conducted the mandatory rounds and inmate counts they were responsible for on the night of August 9th and morning of August 10th. They falsified count slips to cover their actions. *   **Falsified Records:** The OIG found that Thomas and another staff member had knowingly and willfully made false statements on BOP records, falsely claiming to have conducted rounds and counts. *   **Criminal Charges:**  Both men were subsequently indicted on conspiracy and falsification of records charges, though the charges were later dismissed due to deferred prosecution agreements. *   **Security Camera Issues:** The report highlights a history of security camera problems at the facility, contributing to the lack of oversight. Essentially, the report presents a case of negligence and intentional deception by correctional officers that led to Epstein’s death and subsequent legal action.",

Over the following weeks, he underwent multiple psychology evaluations, risk assessments, and interactions with attorneys, often with inconsistencies in documentation, particularly regarding cell assignments tracked in SENTRY.  There were documented instances of misplaced SENTRY transactions and errors in records, including inaccurate inmate counts and missing documentation like intake screenings and 30-day psychology reviews.  On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell, prompting a medical emergency and ultimately his death. The investigation into the incident was inconclusive. The review highlighted significant failures in basic correctional practices, including incomplete inmate counts, inconsistent documentation, and failures to adhere to established suicide prevention protocols. Recommendations were made regarding staff training, institutional processes, and oversight. The estimated cost associated with the incident was approximately $10,741.60.",

The OIG determined there was no criminality associated with Epstein's death, but identified significant misconduct and operational challenges within the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that contributed to the situation.
