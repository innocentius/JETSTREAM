One guard reported that another guard and his partner conducted a 12x8 tour, responded to a body alert in the SHU where Epstein was already receiving CPR, and subsequently escorted the body to Beekman Hospital with EMS. Another guard assisted with the count and then responded to a body alert, observing Epstein being removed from his cell and treated. FBI CART packaged video from the MCC for SDNY, and coordination was made to retrieve and image Thomas’ cell phone. The Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) advised that a final report would be provided soon, with a physician and executive having a meeting regarding the autopsy. Three proffers involving inmates from the MCC were scheduled for Monday, August 26th.",
