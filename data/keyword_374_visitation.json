      "summary": "Department of Justice’s Federal Bureau of Prisons. The program’s purpose is to prevent self-destructive behavior and reduce the risk of inmate suicide. Key elements include: *   **Responsibilities:** The Chief Psychologist is the program coordinator. *   **Procedures:** All staff must immediately refer potentially suicidal inmates to Psychology Services. The Psychology Services Inmate Questionnaire (PSIQ) is used for initial screening. Inmates exhibiting suicidal thoughts or distress receive a suicide watch, typically involving continuous visual observation by inmate companions. *   **Maintenance:**  Suicidal inmates are placed in a designated 2nd floor suicide prevention area, subject to specific procedures regarding companions (gender restrictions), room inspections, and item restrictions. *   **Documentation:** Observations are recorded in a Suicide Watch Log Book. *   **Exceptions:** Specific rules apply for Unit 3 inmates, alternate watch rooms, and certain visitation/phone scenarios, all requiring approval from higher-level authorities. *   **Inmate Companions:**  Volunteers are recruited and trained to monitor inmates on suicide watch, receiving compensation for their time. *   **Staff Training:**  All staff receive training on recognizing suicidal behavior and implementing prevention techniques, with supplemental training for specific units and emergency response exercises. The directive rescinds an older version (NYM 5324.05c) and is effective upon issuance.",

It establishes that the MCC’s primary role is to confine pretrial individuals awaiting conviction, defining them as those not yet receiving notification of their case outcome. The supplement details intake procedures including verification of documents, metal detector searches, and initial assessments (including a SENTRY-based intake screening form) to evaluate the inmate's condition, potential risks, and placement needs. It emphasizes separation from convicted inmates where possible, with waivers permitted in certain circumstances. The procedures cover medical intake screenings, housing assignments, visiting protocols, and record-keeping, with specific attention paid to documenting inmate information and assessing potential security concerns. Finally, the document outlines procedures for release, handling inmates with special needs, and adherence to disciplinary regulations.",

      "summary": "Federal investigators are conducting a criminal investigation at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City, where Jeffrey Epstein died, due to suspected contraband smuggling, specifically a possible gun. The investigation began after receiving information about a potential gun inside the facility.  Lockdowns have been implemented, restricting visitation, legal access, and normal operations.  Corrections officers are under scrutiny, with allegations of negligence and falsified records.  Searches have uncovered contraband like cellphones, but the gun remains missing. Legal proceedings are being delayed, and inmates are experiencing restrictions in their routines, including limited showers and altered meal schedules. The Bureau of Prisons is working to complete the investigation and restore normal operations, with plans for resuming full legal visits within a week.",

A COVID-19 outbreak led to a 14-day quarantine for Maxwell, during which she was permitted standard quarantine privileges (cell, daily checks, limited access, and use of a laptop for discovery review - 13 hours daily). *   **Continued Updates (December 4, 2020 & January 15, 2021):** The Government continued to report on Maxwell’s conditions, emphasizing consistent access to discovery (13 hours daily, seven days a week across both a desktop and laptop), regular video-teleconference calls with her attorneys (five hours per weekday), and the continuation of standard MDC procedures including searches, food service, and water provision. The government’s legal counsel noted that MDC staff monitored Maxwell’s health and weight.  The MDC legal team responded to concerns raised by defense counsel regarding access to the laptop and in-person visits, but without reaching an agreement. *   **Court Order (January 25, 2021):**  Judge Nathan ordered the Government to provide 60-day written updates regarding Maxwell’s confinement, focusing on access to legal materials and searches.  The Court denied the BOP’s request to compel Warden Tellez to appear and respond directly. *   **Final Update (February 4, 2021):** The Government provided a detailed response to the Judge's January order, reinforcing that Maxwell continues to receive the maximum permitted access to discovery and legal communications, detailing standard MDC procedures (including searches, healthcare, and water provision), and addressing previous concerns regarding monitoring and surveillance. The government also reported on the defendant's recent COVID-19 vaccination status.",

Implementing a process for assigning cellmates after suicide watch, with exceptions. 2.  Ensuring continued cellmate assignment for high-risk inmates recommended by psychologists. 3.  Evaluating and standardizing the process for obtaining approval for social/legal visits during suicide watch. 4.  Evaluating inmate whereabouts and wellbeing methods. 5.  Updating Lieutenant round procedures. 6.  Addressing staffing shortages through an automated tool and recruitment incentives. 7.  Improving cell search procedures through staff training. 8.

The FBOP’s response indicates they are drafting guidance for several of these recommendations, primarily through revisions to the Correctional Services Procedures Manual. However, the FBOP’s updates are largely considered non-responsive to the OIG's concerns, particularly regarding the continuity of cellmate assignments and the contingency planning for Epstein’s case.
