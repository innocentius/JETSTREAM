Essentially, the Co-Executors are seeking a structured, expert-led process to manage the complex and potentially costly claims arising from the estate.",

Due to Epstein’s death in August 2019, the firm believes privacy concerns are extinguished and renews their request for all records related to him. They also request public documents relating to potentially related individuals, offering to pay reasonable duplication fees. The EOUSA responded, stating that without authorization, death certificates, or a public justification, releasing these records would violate the Privacy Act. The EOUSA would release public records (court records, news clippings) without requiring third-party consent, and outlined the process for obtaining such records, emphasizing the need for notarized authorization forms.
