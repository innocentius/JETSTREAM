This information relates to Maxwell’s due process rights and Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment protections. Counsel seeks a temporary three-week stay of the unsealing process to allow for consultation with the U.S. Attorney's Office and a potential modification of the protective order. They propose streamlining the unsealing process through modifications to the protocol, including reduced briefing page limits and a shorter objection response period. Counsel also requests the court allow for a 7-day period for Non-Parties to object after a sealing order. Finally, they propose prioritizing specific decided motions for unsealing, excluding those tied to the paused deposition transcripts.",

Specifically: *   **Request 9 (Minor Victim-2’s Diary):** The Government argues this request is improper because the diary is irrelevant given that the defendant and the victim already acknowledged the absence of references to the defendant within the diary, and the diary is full of unrelated personal entries. *   **Request 10 (Pair of Boots):** The Government intends to obtain the boots through BSF and make them available to the defense for examination, effectively mooting this request. *   **Request 11 (Photographs):** The defense already possesses copies of the photographs; the Government argues that the original physical photographs lack relevant metadata and wouldn’t satisfy the *Nixon* standard without further justification. The Government requests the Court to deny Requests 9 and 11 and reserve decision on Request 10 until the Government obtains the boots and makes them available for examination.",
