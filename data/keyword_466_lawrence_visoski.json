Initially, a paralegal specialist produced FAA records related to several aircraft, including N415LM, N212JE, and N550GP, after encountering password-locked files. These files involved registrations dating back to the 1990s and 2000s, with multiple owners and operators, including Air Ghislaine Inc., Freedom Air International Inc., and Hyperion Air LLC.  Numerous individuals, such as Darren K. Indyke and Lawrence VISOSKI, were repeatedly involved in the ownership and management of these aircraft. DEA S/A and the FBI in Atlanta expressed interest in the investigation, requesting assistance and providing search terms.  The investigation uncovered complex transfer histories, changes in tail numbers, and connections between the aircraft and individuals of interest, including Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The investigation culminated in offers to provide blue ribbon certified copies of the aircraft registration records.",
