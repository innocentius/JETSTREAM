Concerns are raised about anonymity and the voluntary nature of any discussions, emphasizing sensitivity and avoiding re-victimization. As the investigation progresses, a shift occurs due to the pandemic, leading to a halt on international travel and a renewed focus on obtaining a summary of the witness’s information. The lawyers repeatedly stress the voluntary nature of any interview, the importance of the witness’s comfort level, and the limitations on accessing notes and disclosing information to other parties. Ultimately, the communication aims to establish a framework for a sensitive and productive interview process.",
