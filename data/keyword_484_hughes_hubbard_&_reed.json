Ruzumna contacted the FBI New York Field Office after a video surfaced during a review, potentially containing CSAM and referencing a prior conviction for a similar offense.

A protocol was established with involved parties for handling potentially illegal material. The review was halted, and Ruzumna requested guidance from the FBI. The communication involved multiple individuals including FBI Special Agents, attorneys from Hughes Hubbard & Reed, and other legal counsel.",
