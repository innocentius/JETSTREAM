Maxwell later claimed to have contacted the police but disappeared, with her death later attributed to a drug overdose and potentially a cover-up. III also mentioned driving Donald Trump in 1995, during which Trump made concerning statements. Finally, he revealed that a man named John W.

This includes covering costs for the FBI and the USAO SDNY. *   **Victim Services:** The USAO SDNY is offering victim services, including counseling, therapy assistance, and resource referrals. Essentially, the document outlines the ongoing logistical and evidentiary support being provided by the government in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, while emphasizing the sensitive nature of the materials and adherence to court orders.",
