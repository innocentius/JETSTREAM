Control panels for ES/GS Main Door/Fire Exit doors and the Inner Gate were inoperative during the morning watch shift.  A Suicide Watch was placed on inmate Epstein #76318-054. Fire Watches were ongoing during the day and evening shifts due to staff shortages in Correctional Assignments SHU #4 and 10-South #2. Several inmates were in outside hospitals, under suicide watch, or on furlough. New and released inmates were recorded, and there were no current triple-bunked SHU cells.  Missing reports and equipment were noted across multiple locations within the facility. Overtime hours were recorded for E-1 staff. The institution’s total inmate population at the beginning of the morning shift was 776.",

There were documented instances of misplaced SENTRY transactions and errors in records, including inaccurate inmate counts and missing documentation like intake screenings and 30-day psychology reviews.  On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell, prompting a medical emergency and ultimately his death. The investigation into the incident was inconclusive. The review highlighted significant failures in basic correctional practices, including incomplete inmate counts, inconsistent documentation, and failures to adhere to established suicide prevention protocols. Recommendations were made regarding staff training, institutional processes, and oversight. The estimated cost associated with the incident was approximately $10,741.60.",
