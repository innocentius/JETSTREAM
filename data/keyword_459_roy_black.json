Alexander Acosta notified Roy Black that Jeffrey Epstein’s application for and participation in the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work release program constituted a breach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. The agreement stipulated eighteen months of incarceration (24/7 confinement), not work release. Acosta detailed previous communications regarding this issue, including disagreements over Epstein’s potential use of Sheriff’s Deputies for security and a failure by the U.S. Attorney’s office to inform the office about a subsequent change of plea to a community control order. Acosta demanded Epstein withdraw his work release application and complete his sentence as outlined in the agreement, threatening legal action if the breach continued.",

Epstein is serving his 18-month sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, not the State-Regulated Community Control Program. This is permitted by Florida Statute 951.24(2Xa) and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office policy, which allows for work release under specific criteria. The Non-Prosecution Agreement does not prohibit this arrangement, and Epstein is afforded the same benefits as other inmates.  A draft notification letter from the U.S. Attorney’s Office regarding Epstein’s potential participation in work release was sent on December 6, 2007.  An email dated July 3, 2008, indicates that the Deputy Sheriff acknowledged the US Attorney’s Office had no objection to the work release program as long as Epstein is treated similarly to other inmates, and that his restrictions were actually more stringent. The attorney states they have no intent to violate the agreement and propose a meeting to discuss the situation.",
