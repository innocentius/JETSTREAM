This status applies to inmates exhibiting mental instability due to mental illness, personality disorders, medical issues, or drug effects, but without imminent suicidal ideation. Procedures involve a psychologist’s determination, continuous monitoring in a suicide watch area or designated cell, restricted items, detailed log entries every 15 minutes, and regular rounds by staff. Specific personnel (Psychologist, Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff, etc.) are notified upon placement or removal, and limitations exist regarding the number of inmates a staff member can monitor simultaneously.",

The investigation was initiated due to concerns about Epstein’s cellmate situation and the handling of his transfer from suicide watch. Key findings include: *   **Cellmate Requirement:** Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to his psychological observation history. *   **Inmate 3’s Transfer:** Inmate 3, Epstein’s cellmate, was transferred from the facility on August 9, 2019, leaving Epstein without a designated cellmate. *   **Failure to Notify:** The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to immediately notify a supervisor about the need for a new cellmate, violating BOP standards and SHU Post Orders. They also offered inconsistent accounts regarding notifications made to other staff. *   **Lack of Cell Searches:** The officer failed to properly document cell searches, potentially missing opportunities to assess Epstein’s needs. There were concerns about an excessive amount of linens in his cell. *   **Inaccurate Count:** The 4:00 PM SHU count on August 9, 2019, was inaccurate due to a miscount of inmates, potentially hindering the realization that Inmate 3 was no longer present. *   **Draft Status:** The document is a draft and subject to revision, emphasizing the sensitivity of the information contained within. It’s marked for limited official use and strict confidentiality.",
