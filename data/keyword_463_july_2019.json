      "summary": "These encounters primarily addressed complaints of neuropathy, back pain, and hyperlipidemia. Initially, Epstein reported tingling/numbness in his hand and right arm, with no pain. Subsequent evaluations revealed a history of obstructive sleep apnea and hyperlipidemia, for which he was prescribed medication.  Medical staff noted concerns about possible nerve damage related to spinal stenosis, but further testing was pending.  Multiple providers documented observations related to his physical condition, medications, and patient education.  A final encounter involved a 6-month follow-up appointment.  One encounter involved a refusal of an optometrist evaluation.  Cosign documentation was required for certain orders and was subsequently provided by a physician.",
