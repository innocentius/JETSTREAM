The government asserts that Thomas’s request is not “material to preparing a defense” and is primarily aimed at attempting to influence a jury through jury nullification.

      "summary": "This document is a legal filing by The New York Times Company and reporter Benjamin Weiser regarding the Government’s attempt to seal judicial records in the United States v. Tartaglione case. The Times argues that the records, pertaining to the transfer of defendant Nicholas Tartaglione from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), are subject to the common law and First Amendment rights of access. Specifically, the records detail Tartaglione’s claims of unsafe conditions at the MCC, stemming from interactions with former cellmate Jeffrey Epstein, and the Government’s subsequent response. The Times contends that these documents constitute “judicial documents” under Second Circuit jurisprudence—relevant to the judicial function, carrying a presumption of access, and possessing significant value for monitoring federal courts. The Times disputes the Government’s justification for sealing the records, asserting that disclosing information about BOP deliberations would not unduly influence inmate behavior or compromise law enforcement functions. They argue that the public interest in transparency regarding the judicial process, particularly in this high-profile case involving Epstein’s suicide, outweighs any potential concerns. The filing concludes by requesting that the Court deny the Government’s application to seal the documents.",

This request was logged in 2019. *   **Record Production:**  The BOP produced records to the plaintiffs in phased releases, beginning in August 2020. *   **Corrections to Previous Declaration:** Christenson corrects an error in her previous declaration regarding the number of scanned visitor logs and the date of a related log entry (from July 30, 2019). *   **Further Production (October 2020):** The BOP produced an additional 351 pages of records, including attorney log books and emails, after reaching agreements with the plaintiffs regarding the handling of records from the Office of Inspector General (OIG). *   **OIG Records Review:** The BOP reviewed approximately 7,475 pages of records returned from the OIG, identifying roughly 6,898 pages as non-responsive or duplicative. 387 pages were withheld in full under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(A). *   **Updated Index:** A revised index of withheld documents (the \"Updated Index\") reduces the number of pages withheld and clarifies the application of exemptions. *   **Exemption Justifications:** The BOP justifies withholding records under Exemptions 6 (privacy of personnel and medical files), 7(A) (law enforcement records), and 7(E) (techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations), citing concerns about privacy, potential harm to individuals, and the need to protect BOP operational security. Specifically, they argue that releasing certain information would risk compromising investigations or endangering BOP employees and inmates.",

The investigation, dated March 202X, focuses on a period around August 9, 2019. Key findings include: *   **Missing Cellmate Accountability:** The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to properly account for Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, resulting in Inmate 3 being permanently transferred from the facility without Epstein having a replacement. *   **False Record Keeping:** The Officer in Charge fabricated count slips to falsely indicate that mandatory rounds and inmate counts had been completed, violating BOP regulations and federal law. *   **Lack of Conduct:** The Officer in Charge failed to conduct assigned duties, including inmate counts and cell searches, and did not notify supervisory personnel when Epstein lacked a cellmate. *   **Witness Contradictions:** Witnesses, including the Officer in Charge, provided inconsistent accounts of events, leading to doubt about their candor during OIG interviews. *   **Potential Policy Violation:** The investigation suggests a broader failure of MCC New York SHU staff to adhere to established protocols regarding inmate supervision and accountability. The OIG concluded that the Officer in Charge’s actions constituted a violation of BOP standards, federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1001), and MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The U.S. Attorney’s Office declined prosecution due to lack of sufficient evidence.",

There were documented instances of misplaced SENTRY transactions and errors in records, including inaccurate inmate counts and missing documentation like intake screenings and 30-day psychology reviews.  On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell, prompting a medical emergency and ultimately his death. The investigation into the incident was inconclusive. The review highlighted significant failures in basic correctional practices, including incomplete inmate counts, inconsistent documentation, and failures to adhere to established suicide prevention protocols. Recommendations were made regarding staff training, institutional processes, and oversight. The estimated cost associated with the incident was approximately $10,741.60.",

Her responsibilities include analyzing, responding to, and monitoring these requests. *   **FOIA Requests:** The request stemmed from The New York Times’s efforts to obtain records regarding Epstein’s death. Specifically, the requests sought: log entries, inmate placement data, investigation reports, visitor records, and communication records related to the events leading up to and following Epstein’s death. *   **BOP Search & Redactions:** The BOP conducted a search for responsive records, primarily utilizing databases like SENTRY and BEMR.  Many records were withheld due to exemptions, primarily 7(A) (law enforcement proceedings) and 5 (internal agency communications). *   **Exemption Justifications:** The BOP cited concerns that releasing the information could interfere with ongoing law enforcement investigations or reveal investigative techniques. They used exceptions 7(A) and 7(E) *   **Aggregation of Requests:** Two separate FOIA requests were consolidated into a single request number (2019-05665). *   **Final Determination:** The BOP issued a final determination response denying the requests in full, citing the applicable exemptions. *   **Appeal:** Plaintiff, The New York Times, appealed the BOP’s determination, which was partially affirmed by the Office of Information Policy (OIP).",

Matthews was released despite a permanent order of detention and a prior escape charge. The release, combined with Epstein’s death while on suicide watch with significant protocol failures (including infrequent checks and lack of a cellmate), has prompted a full investigation by the U.S. Attorney and the Attorney General, focusing on alleged inadequacies and potential irregularities within the MCC. Concerns have been raised regarding low staff levels, inhumane conditions, and a systemic crisis within the federal prison system.",

The core of the inquiry revolves around whether the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was required to document Epstein’s calls beyond standard BOP policy, specifically if the SDNY prosecutors or Judge required detailed logging, recording, or monitoring of those conversations. The investigation stemmed from a request for clarification about whether SDNY prosecutors needed to maintain a log of Epstein’s calls at MCC, referencing the term “memorialize phone calls.” Redactions obscure the identities of individuals and organizations involved.",

A New York Times reporter subsequently contacted the NYO, along with Alsharif’s attorney Ingrid McColley, seeking verification of a notification to the FBI in 1996 and a 2006 interview. McColley claimed she contacted the FBI after Epstein’s arrest but received no response.  A search of NYO records revealed no record of Alsharif or McColley contacting the FBI after Epstein's arrest.  A former employee, C-20, stated she worked for Epstein's in the 1990s and provided details of interactions including a visit to his New Mexico ranch and alleged massages. The NY Times was preparing to publish a story based on this information.",

McFarland describes her role in responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s time at the MCC. Here’s a breakdown of the key factual content: *   **McFarland's Role:** She coordinates searches at the MCC when FOIA requests require it, working primarily with GOP’s Central Office. *   **Search Activities:** She directed staff to search various systems and files, including electronic and non-electronic records, the SENTRY database, email systems (SENTRY and TRULINCS), and the BEMR medical record system. *   **Specific Records Examined:** The searches focused on records related to: SHU log entries, Epstein’s quarters history, CIM clearance data, disciplinary records, intake screening forms, security designations, inmate profiles, incident reports, medical reports, visitor logs, phone logs, email communications, and special investigative reports. *   **Findings:** The searches primarily yielded information already documented in the Christenson Declaration. Key findings included: most records related to Epstein had been handed over to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and that MCC staff located some responsive records through their own searches, often overlapping with Central Office’s findings. Notably, no meeting minutes related to Epstein’s suicide watch removal were located. *   **Confirmation:** McFarland confirmed that no other individuals at the MCC (or former employees) were reasonably likely to possess responsive records.",

      "summary": "The hearing was presided over by Judge Richard M. Berman, with representatives from the U.S. Attorney’s Office and defense counsel present. **Key Events and Participants:** *   **Initial Housekeeping:** Judge Berman addressed the participants, outlining the purpose of the hearing—to consider the motion to dismiss due to Epstein’s death. He also acknowledged the significant effort involved and expressed gratitude for the work of the prosecutors and victims. *   **Government’s Argument:** The government, led by Geoffrey Berman, argued that the death of Epstein necessitated the dismissal of the case due to the lack of a live defendant. They emphasized the need for a full and transparent investigation and highlighted the potential for further investigation into co-conspirators. They referenced the legal precedent set by the *U.S. v. Wright* case concerning abatement. *   **Defense’s Argument:** Defense counsel, led by Reid Weingarten, strongly opposed the dismissal, arguing that the court had an inherent authority to continue investigating and pursuing justice, regardless of Epstein's death. They raised concerns about the government’s handling of the investigation and questioned the credibility of the medical examiner’s findings regarding the cause of death. They invoked precedent from *U.S. v. Heaton* and suggested the possibility of a parallel investigation by the court. *   **Victim Testimonies:** Multiple Jane Doe victims, represented by Gloria Allred’s firm, offered statements detailing their experiences and the ongoing trauma caused by Epstein’s actions. They expressed a desire for justice and accountability. *   **Legal Discussions:** Throughout the hearing, the lawyers discussed relevant legal principles, including the “abatement” doctrine, the Crime Victims' Rights Act, and the role of the government in investigating and prosecuting crimes. The discussion centered on the court’s authority to continue the case despite Epstein's death. **Outcome (as presented):** The hearing concluded with Judge Berman stating that he would consider the arguments and would likely move forward with an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death, reinforcing the importance of victims’ rights and ongoing investigation. **Additional Notes:** *   The text contains several references to ongoing investigations and potential further legal action. *   There were discussions regarding the handling of evidence, the role of the FBI, and the need for transparency in the investigation. *   The hearing showcased the complex legal and ethical issues involved in a case where the defendant has died before a trial concludes.",

The USAO and FBI provided the OCME with materials and information during the investigation, and the U.S. Attorney requested the OCME to not share these materials, including names of federal law enforcement agents involved, with any third party, until the criminal investigation concluded.",

Initially, MCC’s position was that visits were only permitted for mitigation preparation, and Nick’s frequent misunderstandings hindered communication. However, after discussion, MCC offered a social phone call, which Barket considered inadequate. The request for a social visit was complicated by the fact that Nick was in a capital case. The involved parties, including staff attorneys at CLC New York and the US Attorney’s office, discussed the possibility of intervention and the need for mitigation preparation, emphasizing the importance of maintaining access to communication methods like monitored visits and phone calls. Ultimately, a social phone call was offered as a temporary solution pending further discussion with administrators.",

She frames the resolution as a necessary check on presidential power due to her concerns about potential escalation. *   **Republican Opposition:** Republican lawmakers, particularly Kevin McCarthy and Lindsey Graham, heavily criticize Slotkin and the resolution, framing it as unpatriotic and potentially empowering the enemy. They highlight the personal investment Slotkin has in the conflict. *   **Senate Support:** Senator Tim Kaine, a key sponsor of the resolution, shares a similar personal connection – his son is a Marine infantry officer deployed overseas. He is working to secure enough Republican support for passage. *   **Escalating Tensions:** The situation is further complicated by the downing of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran, with growing speculation about U.S. involvement and heightened tensions with Iran, including a renewed condemnation of the nuclear deal. *   **Political Maneuvering:** The GOP is attempting to discredit the resolution, with some openly mocking Slotkin and questioning her motivations. Other Republican voices, like Matt Gaetz, defend her actions, pointing to her military service. *   **Other Developments:** The document also covers a range of related political developments, including: the narrowing support for Joe Biden in the Democratic primary, ongoing debate over the impeachment articles, and revelations about Jared Kushner’s diminished role in the administration. It mentions a controversial charity event for Pence and a Republican senator’s meeting with a Democratic colleague about climate change. Finally, it details an attempt by a former presidential candidate, Marianne Williamson, to raise awareness about the situation.",

Specifically, the defense argues: *   The footage would have been exculpatory, corroborating Tartaglione’s account of events. *   The Government’s explanation for the footage’s destruction is inadequate, lacking specificity and sworn testimony. *   The BOP, which held exclusive control of the footage, failed to preserve it despite a clear preservation request. *   The loss of the footage potentially impacts the punishment phase of a capital case, as it contains mitigating evidence related to Tartaglione’s actions. The defense seeks answers to questions about who destroyed the footage, the chain of responsibility, whether witnesses reviewed it, and whether the destruction was deliberate or due to negligence. They believe the loss constitutes a deprivation of a constitutional right to present mitigating evidence and is “chargeable to the state.”",

She maintains contact with former colleagues and has worked as an independent prison consultant since 2017. *   **Purpose of Declaration:** Baird was asked to offer an expert opinion on the conditions of confinement for Assange if he were to be placed under Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) within the Bureau of Prisons system. *   **SAMs Expertise:** Baird’s expertise stems from her direct experience managing SAMs inmates at institutions like MCC New York and USP Marion, specifically focusing on the Communication Management Unit (CMU). *   **Assange’s Alleged Charges:** Assange is facing extradition charges including Conspiracy to Receive National Defense Information, Obtaining National Defense Information, Disclosure of National Defense Information, and Conspiracy to Commit Computer Intrusion. *   **SAMs Description:** Baird describes SAMs as restrictions on social visits, phone calls, correspondence, and placement in restrictive housing, common for inmates awaiting trial or those deemed a security risk. *   **ADX Florence Context:** Baird highlights the ADX Florence (Special Management Unit) as a facility where SAMs inmates are typically housed, and the potential for lengthy isolation within it. *   **CMU Details:** Baird explains the limitations of the CMU, emphasizing restricted communication and program access. *   **Psychological Assessments:** Baird reviews the psychological assessments concerning Assange’s potential for suicide, noting concerns about mental health services within the BOP. *   **Policy and Procedure Reviews:** Baird discusses the BOP's policies regarding inmate placement, particularly concerning restrictive housing and the Administrative Remedy Program. *   **Expert Opinions:** Baird’s overall opinion is that Assange would likely face severe restrictions and prolonged isolation if placed under SAMs, reflecting the realities of the BOP’s system. *   **Final Attestation:** Baird confirms the accuracy and completeness of her declaration under penalty of perjury.",

The investigation began after receiving information about a potential gun inside the facility.  Lockdowns have been implemented, restricting visitation, legal access, and normal operations.  Corrections officers are under scrutiny, with allegations of negligence and falsified records.  Searches have uncovered contraband like cellphones, but the gun remains missing. Legal proceedings are being delayed, and inmates are experiencing restrictions in their routines, including limited showers and altered meal schedules. The Bureau of Prisons is working to complete the investigation and restore normal operations, with plans for resuming full legal visits within a week.",

He expressed disappointment that U.S. Attorney General William Barr had not conducted a thorough investigation, referencing concerns raised by an April 30 report by epidemiologist Homer Venters detailing deficiencies in medical care and protocol at the MDC. The judge’s comments occurred during the sentencing of Terrance Morgan for bank fraud conspiracy, and he indicated that the conditions influenced his decision to sentence Morgan to time served, home confinement, and supervised release.

Russell Capone, counsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney, asserts that releasing these records – specifically those withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(A) – would likely interfere with ongoing criminal prosecutions involving Epstein and the individuals involved. The declaration focuses on four key categories of withheld records: inmate counts, staffing records, psychological notes, and BOP logs from August 9-10, 2019. Capone argues that disclosing these records, particularly in their entirety, could unduly influence witnesses’ testimony at trial, skew potential jurors’ perceptions, and exacerbate media speculation surrounding Epstein’s death. He contends that this interference is heightened by the ongoing Noel and Tartaglione prosecutions and the potential relevance of the information to a penalty phase in the Tartaglione case.  Ultimately, Capone argues that the records should remain withheld in their entirety to protect the integrity of the legal proceedings.",

      "summary": "This document is a supplemental declaration submitted in support of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) motion for summary judgment in a case involving the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein. Russell Capone, counsel to the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, argues that the BOP’s withholding of records from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) under Exemption 7(A) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is justified. Specifically, Capone asserts that releasing records related to Epstein’s incarceration at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) – including inmate rosters, staffing records, psychological notes, and log entries – would likely interfere with ongoing prosecutions of both Jeffrey Epstein and co-defendant Vincent Tartaglione. He argues this interference stems from the potential influence on witnesses’ testimony, the ability to shape juror perceptions, and the risk of fueling public speculation about Epstein’s death. He further contends that the information is inextricably linked to potentially exculpatory data, especially given the media coverage surrounding the case. Capone highlights the potential relevance of the withheld records to the penalty phase of Tartaglione’s case, emphasizing the need to protect the fairness of the jury selection process. Finally, he argues for the segregation of the records as a whole due to the intertwined nature of the information and the potential for misleading jurors.",

They also raise concerns about potential bias based on race, gender, and class. *   **The Request:** The United States Attorney’s Office is preparing a declaration from the BOP to justify the differing treatment, outlining the reasons for Maxwell's enhanced access. *   **Timeline:** The declaration is due by December 31st, and the attorneys are coordinating to identify a suitable declarant and draft the explanation.",

The legal team is preparing a declaration for Judge Engelmayer explaining why these differing accommodations are justified due to the distinct housing situations and the specific requests of the lawyers. The disparity in access is considered “striking” and potentially discriminatory, raising concerns about the optics of the case.

Rivera’s access to his laptop and increased video calls with counsel are being significantly restricted. **Key Points:** *   **Laptop Access:** Rivera initially received his laptop in the SHU, but access was abruptly denied after a transfer due to staff’s unawareness of the Judge’s order. Subsequent access was intermittent and dependent on daily reports, often hampered by staff concerns and discomfort, including concerning remarks about Rivera being an “enemy #1.” *   **Increased Video Calls:** Rivera’s legal team requested two 2-hour video calls per week, citing limitations imposed by the MCC and the need for effective preparation for his trial (scheduled to begin February 16, 2021). This request was repeatedly denied by the MCC, who offered only a single 4-hour session, despite the Court's order. *   **Concerns Regarding Conditions:** The legal team expresses serious concerns about Rivera’s conditions of confinement, including hostile staff behavior, limited access to counsel, and the stressful environment. They note the disparity in treatment compared to Ghislaine Maxwell, who enjoys significantly greater access to discovery and counsel. *   **COVID-19 Impact:** The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak at the MCC is cited as a reason for restricted movement and access, further complicating Rivera's situation. *   **Lack of Response:** Despite the Court’s orders, the MCC is not fulfilling the requested accommodations, creating further obstacles to Rivera's legal defense.",

Initially, the Court addressed a “Curcio issue” – a confidential matter involving counsel for Mr. Tartaglione, Ms. Sternheim. The primary focus shifted to the government’s request to seal letters regarding prison conditions, prison designation, and Mr. Tartaglione’s housing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) and Medium Medium Correctional Facility (MDC). The government sought to seal letters dated August 23rd and 28th, arguing it protected BOP’s deliberative process and prevented inmates from manipulating housing assignments. The Court ultimately ruled that the letters *were* judicial documents due to their relevance to Mr. Tartaglione’s trial rights and the court’s oversight. The Court then rejected the government's argument to maintain the seal, ordering its unsealing due to a lack of demonstrated compelling interest and concerns about potential manipulation of security protocols. Finally, the court addressed concerns about a telephone seized from Mr. Tartaglione, and the government abandoned the effort to obtain a warrant for it. Counsel proposed a timeline for trial scheduling, pending further discussion with the government.",

Due to Epstein’s death in August 2019, the firm believes privacy concerns are extinguished and renews their request for all records related to him. They also request public documents relating to potentially related individuals, offering to pay reasonable duplication fees. The EOUSA responded, stating that without authorization, death certificates, or a public justification, releasing these records would violate the Privacy Act. The EOUSA would release public records (court records, news clippings) without requiring third-party consent, and outlined the process for obtaining such records, emphasizing the need for notarized authorization forms.

Key findings include: Epstein’s death was determined to be a suicide by the FBI and Medical Examiner, supported by the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The initial narrative of an inmate killing Epstein was disputed due to lack of witness accounts, camera footage, and the absence of counts and rounds conducted. Details were added regarding inmate observations, cell door procedures, and the handling of Epstein’s body after his death, including a change of clothes in violation of BOP policy. The report also includes expanded information from interviews regarding the events leading up to Epstein’s death, including his request to remain with his cellmate.",
