Segregation of recordings based on \"witness statements\" is requested. *   **Space Requirements:** The defense needs a suitable space (potentially the largest proffer room or a locked courtroom) to accommodate the team and evidence. *   **Confidentiality:**  Strict protocols are in place for handling highly confidential materials, including the 2,100 images and 7 hard-copy materials. The FBI will provide a single laptop for reviewing the electronic images. *   **Timeline:** The FBI proposes arranging for the client to be produced to 500 Pearl Street during the week of April 12th and April 19th, followed by daily reviews. *   **Ongoing Communication:** Frequent communication is essential to address any issues or disagreements, and the FBI will provide updates on the availability of equipment and the status of the evidence review. *   **Excel Spreadsheet:** The FBI provides an index of physical evidence in its custody, alongside a discovery cover letter, and requests information regarding the number of people who will be present for the physical evidence review.",
