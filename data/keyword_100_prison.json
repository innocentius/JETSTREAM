      "summary": "This document outlines procedures for the creation and operation of Boards of Inquiry and Inquiry Teams within the U.S. Department of Justice’s Federal Bureau of Prisons. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: *   **Purpose:** These teams investigate incidents and situations, gathering evidence, determining causes, and recommending corrective steps. They’re primarily used for significant or unusual incidents. *   **Authority:** The Director creates Boards of Inquiry, while Regional Directors or Wardens create Inquiry Teams (with Director approval). *   **OIA Involvement:** The Office of Internal Affairs (OIA) plays a crucial role, particularly in staff misconduct cases, ensuring employee rights and evidence preservation. An OIA member is typically included on Boards of Inquiry involving misconduct. OIA also assists teams with consultations and expenses. *   **Reporting Requirements:** Reports must be detailed, including recommendations, and may be subject to release under FOIA or subpoena if related to legal proceedings. *   **Team Composition:** Boards and Teams can include Bureau staff, legal counsel, and external experts. Regional Teams should avoid solely consisting of staff from one institution. *   **Interview Procedures:** Strict guidelines govern witness interviews, including advising on rights, confidentiality, and potential legal implications (e.g., Miranda rights if criminal misconduct is suspected). *   **Documentation:** Comprehensive records (notes, photos, recordings) are preserved throughout the inquiry process. Essentially, this document establishes a formalized process for investigating incidents within the Bureau of Prisons, emphasizing thoroughness, legal considerations, and accountability.",

      "summary": "This document outlines the Bureau of Prisons’ suicide prevention program, effective March 15, 2007. Its purpose is to identify and manage potentially suicidal inmates through staff training and observation. Key changes include: three mock suicide emergency exercises per year (one in the SHU), specific criteria for suicide risk assessments and post-watch reports, designated suicide watch rooms (requiring regional director approval), and procedures for notifying psychology services upon inmate requests for protective custody. The program involves staff training, inmate observation, and documentation of all events. The document references various Bureau directives and standards, including those related to discipline, housing units, psychological services, and use of force.  It establishes a formal process for responding to inmate suicide attempts, including after-action reviews and documentation requirements. Finally, the document details procedures for managing inmates in SHUs and uses of inmate observers within the inmate companion program.",

Key elements include: *   **Responsibilities:** The Chief Psychologist is the program coordinator. *   **Procedures:** All staff must immediately refer potentially suicidal inmates to Psychology Services. The Psychology Services Inmate Questionnaire (PSIQ) is used for initial screening. Inmates exhibiting suicidal thoughts or distress receive a suicide watch, typically involving continuous visual observation by inmate companions. *   **Maintenance:**  Suicidal inmates are placed in a designated 2nd floor suicide prevention area, subject to specific procedures regarding companions (gender restrictions), room inspections, and item restrictions. *   **Documentation:** Observations are recorded in a Suicide Watch Log Book. *   **Exceptions:** Specific rules apply for Unit 3 inmates, alternate watch rooms, and certain visitation/phone scenarios, all requiring approval from higher-level authorities. *   **Inmate Companions:**  Volunteers are recruited and trained to monitor inmates on suicide watch, receiving compensation for their time. *   **Staff Training:**  All staff receive training on recognizing suicidal behavior and implementing prevention techniques, with supplemental training for specific units and emergency response exercises.

He is accused of paying underage girls, including one as young as 14, for “massage” sessions at his waterfront home. Police investigations revealed evidence of his knowledge of the girls’ ages through their MySpace pages. State Attorney Barry Krischer initially sent the case to a grand jury, and federal authorities also became involved, delaying the state’s case. Epstein’s legal team includes prominent defense attorneys like Jack Goldberger and Alan Dershowitz. The grand jury returned a charge carrying a maximum five-year prison term, and it's anticipated that Epstein will avoid a “sex offender label” through a plea deal expected to conclude within two months. The article expresses concern that Epstein’s wealth may have afforded him preferential treatment within the justice system.",

Multiple applications were joined for efficiency. *   **US Charges:** The applicants faced charges related to alleged support for terrorism, including conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, hostage-taking, and money laundering. *   **UK Court Findings:** The High Court of the UK ultimately ruled against the applicants, concluding that while conditions at ADX Florence posed a significant risk, and the length of potential sentences was problematic, the government’s assurances and the overall situation did not constitute a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It emphasized the importance of the U.S. judicial system. *   **ADX Florence Concerns:** A central issue was the detention conditions at ADX Florence, a high-security prison, with concerns raised about sensory deprivation, solitary confinement, and the potential imposition of special administrative measures. The Court considered these concerns, acknowledging the risk but finding that under the circumstances, it did not constitute a breach of the Convention. *   **Sentence Length:** The Court also considered the potential for life sentences, determining that unless these were grossly disproportionate, they would not violate Article 3. *   **Deferral of Second Applicant's Case:** The Court deferred consideration of the second applicant's complaints, requesting further submissions on the matter. *   **Continuing Indications:** The ECHR continued to issue indications to the UK government under Rule 39 of its rules of court, requiring the government to refrain from extraditing the applicants until the case was resolved.",

      "summary": "A New York Times reporter, Danielle Ivory, submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for records related to Jeffrey Epstein’s time in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). The request seeks logs of phone calls, email correspondence, visitor lists, and approved contact lists for Epstein. Ivory argues the request is in the public interest due to the significant public interest surrounding Epstein’s death, potential government involvement, and the newspaper’s role in informing the public. She requests the records be provided electronically and fees be waived, citing the public’s right to access government information and the importance of transparency. The BOP acknowledges the request and outlines response time, fee waiver provisions, and considerations regarding potential exemptions under FOIA.",

His lawyers proposed house arrest with electronic monitoring and 24/7 security guards. Prosecutors argued he posed an “extraordinary risk of flight” due to his immense wealth and the potential for him to flee prosecution. A previous judge rejected a similar proposal in 2016. Epstein was arrested on a private jet after arriving from Paris and is currently detained awaiting trial, facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted.",

Essentially, the analysis argues that Epstein’s sentence was a result of a specific legal loophole exploited by the involved parties, leading to a potentially lenient outcome for a serious offender.",

Key points from the declaration: *   **Background:** Christenson works at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota, and her previous declaration details her role. *   **FOIA Requests:** The BOP received a separate FOIA request (not from the plaintiffs) for MCC video records in August 2019. This request was logged in 2019. *   **Record Production:**  The BOP produced records to the plaintiffs in phased releases, beginning in August 2020. *   **Corrections to Previous Declaration:** Christenson corrects an error in her previous declaration regarding the number of scanned visitor logs and the date of a related log entry (from July 30, 2019). *   **Further Production (October 2020):** The BOP produced an additional 351 pages of records, including attorney log books and emails, after reaching agreements with the plaintiffs regarding the handling of records from the Office of Inspector General (OIG). *   **OIG Records Review:** The BOP reviewed approximately 7,475 pages of records returned from the OIG, identifying roughly 6,898 pages as non-responsive or duplicative. 387 pages were withheld in full under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(A). *   **Updated Index:** A revised index of withheld documents (the \"Updated Index\") reduces the number of pages withheld and clarifies the application of exemptions. *   **Exemption Justifications:** The BOP justifies withholding records under Exemptions 6 (privacy of personnel and medical files), 7(A) (law enforcement records), and 7(E) (techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations), citing concerns about privacy, potential harm to individuals, and the need to protect BOP operational security. Specifically, they argue that releasing certain information would risk compromising investigations or endangering BOP employees and inmates.",

The investigation focused on discrepancies in inmate counts, particularly at 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019, where the SHU had a reported 73 inmates, while the Receiving and Discharge unit had zero. Senior Officer Specialist 6 admitted to “ghost counting” – altering count slips without a proper recount – to reflect a more favorable number of inmates. He acknowledged that he should have requested a new count, but did not. The investigation determined that he cleared the inaccurate 10:00 p.m. count, violating BOP policy, and that he continued to misreport inmate counts during subsequent counts (12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m.) despite knowing they were inaccurate. The document emphasizes the poor quality of SHU video footage and the reliance on witness statements and BOP records to assess the situation. The report includes redacted portions of the document and the official name for the document used to record an institutional count (\"Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet\").",

Specifically, the requests sought: log entries, inmate placement data, investigation reports, visitor records, and communication records related to the events leading up to and following Epstein’s death. *   **BOP Search & Redactions:** The BOP conducted a search for responsive records, primarily utilizing databases like SENTRY and BEMR.

They used exceptions 7(A) and 7(E) *   **Aggregation of Requests:** Two separate FOIA requests were consolidated into a single request number (2019-05665). *   **Final Determination:** The BOP issued a final determination response denying the requests in full, citing the applicable exemptions. *   **Appeal:** Plaintiff, The New York Times, appealed the BOP’s determination, which was partially affirmed by the Office of Information Policy (OIP).",

Key points include: *   **Criticism of FITARA:** Several individuals criticize the FITARA law and its impact on BOP IT systems. *   **NICEVision Concerns:**  There’s widespread dissatisfaction with NICEVision, citing database errors, incompatibility, and a lack of user-friendliness. Some users believe the system is not well-suited for the BOP’s needs. *   **Standardization Debate:**  A core discussion revolves around standardizing camera systems nationwide, with arguments for and against adopting NICEVision. *   **SIGNET Contract:**  A significant concern is the BOP’s contract with SIGNET for DVR/NVR system maintenance, which is now focused solely on NICE, creating a potential bottleneck. *   **User Feedback:** The emails contain individual experiences and preferences regarding camera systems, with some users expressing nostalgia for older, familiar systems. The document appears to be a record of troubleshooting efforts and discussions surrounding the rollout of NICEVision within the BOP.",

McFarland describes her role in responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s time at the MCC. Here’s a breakdown of the key factual content: *   **McFarland's Role:** She coordinates searches at the MCC when FOIA requests require it, working primarily with GOP’s Central Office. *   **Search Activities:** She directed staff to search various systems and files, including electronic and non-electronic records, the SENTRY database, email systems (SENTRY and TRULINCS), and the BEMR medical record system. *   **Specific Records Examined:** The searches focused on records related to: SHU log entries, Epstein’s quarters history, CIM clearance data, disciplinary records, intake screening forms, security designations, inmate profiles, incident reports, medical reports, visitor logs, phone logs, email communications, and special investigative reports. *   **Findings:** The searches primarily yielded information already documented in the Christenson Declaration. Key findings included: most records related to Epstein had been handed over to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and that MCC staff located some responsive records through their own searches, often overlapping with Central Office’s findings. Notably, no meeting minutes related to Epstein’s suicide watch removal were located. *   **Confirmation:** McFarland confirmed that no other individuals at the MCC (or former employees) were reasonably likely to possess responsive records.",

Following Epstein’s death, Barr immediately initiated multiple federal inquiries, including investigations by the FBI and the Inspector General, and took swift action to suspend and replace key prison personnel. The investigation stemmed from concerns about the Justice Department’s handling of Epstein’s earlier sex trafficking investigation and fueled by conspiracy theories. Barr personally oversaw the inquiries, subpoenaed prison officials, and sought to hold accountable those responsible for perceived failures in Epstein’s supervision and security. The investigation was complicated by the politically sensitive nature of the case and by Barr’s own ties to Epstein’s legal team. The investigation revealed multiple protocol breaches and a lack of consistent oversight, raising questions about whether appropriate measures were taken to prevent Epstein’s death.",

Bruce Barket responded, clarifying that the request was governed by specific procedures and would be fulfilled by the end of the week under the protective order, contingent on obtaining a release from the inmate (Touhy) and a subpoena. The Assistant US Attorney requested a release, letter, and subpoena for the request to be considered locally.",

Sasse had previously urged the DOJ to investigate its handling of the Epstein case, demanding “heads must roll” and criticizing plea deals that shielded co-conspirators.  He had advocated for a February 2019 investigation into the DOJ’s handling of Epstein’s charges and for the prosecution of sex trafficking.",

The charges stem from allegations that between 1994 and 1997, Maxwell facilitated and participated in the abuse of young girls, often grooming them and arranging travel to locations including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. She is accused of manipulating victims and normalizing the abuse. The case was investigated by the FBI and NYPD, and Maxwell faces potential sentences of up to 35 years in prison. The document emphasizes that the charges are allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.",

Initially, bail was denied in July 2020 due to a deemed high risk of flight. Maxwell filed multiple motions for release, proposing conditions like renouncing her citizenship and establishing a monitored bank account. However, the court consistently rejected these motions, citing ongoing concerns about her risk of flight, the seriousness of the charges (carrying lengthy prison sentences), and her lack of candor regarding her finances and family ties. In her third motion (Dkt. No. 160), Maxwell attempted to address the court’s previous concerns by proposing a retired federal judge as an asset monitor. However, the court again denied the motion, finding that these new conditions did not sufficiently mitigate the risk of flight, citing uncertainties regarding the enforceability of her proposed actions (like renouncing citizenship) and the continued presence of significant financial resources that could facilitate escape. Ultimately, the court maintains that no conditions can reasonably ensure Maxwell’s appearance in court and denies her third motion for bail.",

This stems from the seriousness of the charges (carrying lengthy prison sentences), the strength of the government’s evidence (including multiple witnesses), Maxwell’s significant resources and foreign connections, and her perceived lack of full candor regarding her finances. *   **New Information Unpersuasive:** Maxwell’s proposed bail package, including a substantial financial commitment and increased conditions of confinement, doesn’t alter the court’s judgment. New evidence, like letters of support and a financial report, doesn’t outweigh the flight risk concerns. *   **Continued Detention:** The court reaffirms its decision to detain Maxwell without bail, citing continued concerns about her risk of flight and the fact that a hearing to reconsider the issue is unnecessary.",

Russell Capone, counsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney, asserts that releasing these records – specifically those withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(A) – would likely interfere with ongoing criminal prosecutions involving Epstein and the individuals involved. The declaration focuses on four key categories of withheld records: inmate counts, staffing records, psychological notes, and BOP logs from August 9-10, 2019. Capone argues that disclosing these records, particularly in their entirety, could unduly influence witnesses’ testimony at trial, skew potential jurors’ perceptions, and exacerbate media speculation surrounding Epstein’s death. He contends that this interference is heightened by the ongoing Noel and Tartaglione prosecutions and the potential relevance of the information to a penalty phase in the Tartaglione case.  Ultimately, Capone argues that the records should remain withheld in their entirety to protect the integrity of the legal proceedings.",

Russell Capone, counsel to the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, argues that the BOP’s withholding of records from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) under Exemption 7(A) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is justified. Specifically, Capone asserts that releasing records related to Epstein’s incarceration at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) – including inmate rosters, staffing records, psychological notes, and log entries – would likely interfere with ongoing prosecutions of both Jeffrey Epstein and co-defendant Vincent Tartaglione. He argues this interference stems from the potential influence on witnesses’ testimony, the ability to shape juror perceptions, and the risk of fueling public speculation about Epstein’s death. He further contends that the information is inextricably linked to potentially exculpatory data, especially given the media coverage surrounding the case. Capone highlights the potential relevance of the withheld records to the penalty phase of Tartaglione’s case, emphasizing the need to protect the fairness of the jury selection process. Finally, he argues for the segregation of the records as a whole due to the intertwined nature of the information and the potential for misleading jurors.",

They highlight the expedited discovery production already provided (over 165,000 pages) and point to relevant case precedents (Cannone & Rueb) where similar requests were denied due to prematurity or lack of justification. The Government argues that the defense’s complaints are based on a misunderstanding of the ongoing discovery process and that a motion for a bill of particulars would be the appropriate vehicle for addressing concerns about the charges. Concerning confinement conditions, the Government states that the defendant’s complaints about her placement at MDC are unfounded, citing standard monitoring practices for inmates and highlighting the BOP’s individualized assessment process. They express willingness to discuss arrangements for discovery access but ultimately reject the defendant's demand for the court to dictate her conditions of incarceration. In conclusion, the Government requests that both of Maxwell's requests be denied.",

      "summary": "This document is a transcript of a phone call between defense counsel (Sternheim and Everdell) and MDC legal counsel regarding a female inmate, GM, held at a Bureau of Prisons facility (MDC). Key issues discussed include: *   **Excessive Surveillance:** GM is subjected to constant surveillance, including a second camera pointed into the visiting room, frequent wake-up calls, and intrusive searches (including strip searches) that are significantly more extensive than those given to other inmates. *   **Differential Treatment:** GM receives enhanced privileges (extended computer access, shower, phone, TV) due to her situation, leading to concerns she is effectively in solitary confinement. This treatment is driven, in part, by the need to review a large volume of discovery. *   **Requests for Change:** Sternheim requests the Warden be brought before Judge Nathan to explain the justification for the surveillance and searching, specifically requesting the removal of the second camera and a reduction in intrusive searches to match those of other inmates. *   **Day Room Concerns:** The conversation repeatedly returns to the issue of GM being housed in a day room, which would mitigate many of the current problems, but is not being implemented. *   **Discovery Access:** There is a substantial amount of discovery material for GM to review, and the defense is seeking an extension to facilitate this process. The overall tone reflects frustration with the BOP's handling of GM's case and a strong advocacy for her rights and well-being.",

Here’s a breakdown of the key points: *   **The Issue:** Judge Engelmayer is demanding an explanation from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) why Ghislaine Maxwell receives significantly greater access to electronic discovery and in-person counsel visits than Justin Rivera, despite similar court orders. *   **Rivera’s Situation:** Justin Rivera, detained at the MCC, is receiving limited laptop access (3 hours/day) and restricted videoconference time (6 hours/week) due to his housing situation within the general population. *   **Maxwell’s Situation:** Ghislaine Maxwell, housed in protective custody at the MDC outside the general population, has access to 13 hours/day for electronic discovery review and 15 hours/week for videoconferences. *   **The Argument:** Defense counsel argues the disparity is due to different housing situations – Maxwell's unique protective custody allows for greater access. They also raise concerns about potential bias based on race, gender, and class. *   **The Request:** The United States Attorney’s Office is preparing a declaration from the BOP to justify the differing treatment, outlining the reasons for Maxwell's enhanced access. *   **Timeline:** The declaration is due by December 31st, and the attorneys are coordinating to identify a suitable declarant and draft the explanation.",

To achieve this dismissal with prejudice, Plaintiff secured a settlement agreement with Plaintiff through a Victim Compensation Program, requiring Plaintiff to release all claims against the Estate and related parties in exchange for compensation and a signed release (General Release). The Court ordered the dismissal, including specific conditions: the dismissal must be “with prejudice,” and each party bears its own fees and costs.

Maxwell objected to the condition regarding attorney’s fees and costs, but the Court ultimately upheld the dismissal.

However, Maxwell objected and proposed additional conditions regarding attorney’s fees, costs, and access to the release agreement. *   **Maxwell’s Objections:** Maxwell argued that the stipulation regarding fees and costs was problematic and that she should be allowed to seek fees as the prevailing party and to sue for abuse of process. She also requested a copy of the unredacted release agreement. *   **Court’s Order:** The Court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, subject to the proposed conditions – modification of the fee and cost provision, allowing Maxwell to seek fees as the prevailing party, and providing her with the unredacted release. The parties were given until March 19, 2021, to indicate their agreement.",

Specifically, gaps exist in production numbers (11/18-12/18), and there's confusion regarding the origin of files with inconsistent metadata. *   **Request for Clarification:** The sender seeks clarification on whether the 11/18-12/18 production gap was intentional.

Allegations arose that Maxwell’s lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing her with materials during a visit. Maxwell’s lawyers denied the allegations and threatened legal action. The Court ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to questions about the incident and ensure confidentiality. The Court declined to order MDC to turn over video tapes of the visit, but emphasized the need for Maxwell to meet confidentially with her lawyers. The Judge ordered government and MDC counsel to confer to maintain access to confidential communications and resolve any future issues amicably.",

These revisions require adherence to the standard BOP policy development and Union negotiation processes, meaning changes are subject to modification. *   **Specific Recommendations & Responses:** *   **Cellmate Assignment:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5321.09 to establish a process for assigning cellmates after suicide watch, with exceptions considered. *   **Continued Cellmate Placement:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5321.09 to ensure inmates at high risk remain with a cellmate until recommendations are changed. *   **Social/Legal Visit Approvals:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5324.08 to standardize the process for obtaining approvals for social/legal visits for inmates on suicide watch. *   **Inmate Wellbeing Accounting:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5500.14 to improve accounting for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing. *   **Lieutenant Round Procedures:** The BOP is revising Program Statement 5500.14 to clarify Lieutenant procedures during rounds. *   **Staffing Shortages:** The BOP is analyzing staffing incentives and reducing incentive spending due to budget constraints. They are also exploring funding options for a nationwide special salary rate. *   **Security Camera Systems:** The BOP is revising Program Statements 5500.15 and 4200.12 to mandate video recording capacity and regular system functionality checks. *   **OIG Monitoring:** The OIG will continue to monitor the BOP’s progress and consider closing recommendations once final policies are finalized and provided to the OIG for review.  The OIG will also track updates related to GAO and Congressional inquiries. *   **Ongoing Efforts:** The BOP is actively engaged in implementing these changes, though progress is contingent on the Union negotiation process and budgetary constraints.",

Initially, the Court addressed a “Curcio issue” – a confidential matter involving counsel for Mr. Tartaglione, Ms. Sternheim. The primary focus shifted to the government’s request to seal letters regarding prison conditions, prison designation, and Mr. Tartaglione’s housing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) and Medium Medium Correctional Facility (MDC). The government sought to seal letters dated August 23rd and 28th, arguing it protected BOP’s deliberative process and prevented inmates from manipulating housing assignments. The Court ultimately ruled that the letters *were* judicial documents due to their relevance to Mr. Tartaglione’s trial rights and the court’s oversight. The Court then rejected the government's argument to maintain the seal, ordering its unsealing due to a lack of demonstrated compelling interest and concerns about potential manipulation of security protocols. Finally, the court addressed concerns about a telephone seized from Mr. Tartaglione, and the government abandoned the effort to obtain a warrant for it. Counsel proposed a timeline for trial scheduling, pending further discussion with the government.",

The R2 value for this relationship was 0.002. *   **Moderate to Strong Correlation with FSA Positions:** There *was* a correlation between inmate participation in specific programs (RDAP, NRDAP, and MAT) and the number of filled FSA positions. *   A moderate correlation was found between inmate participation in the MAT program and filled FSA positions (R2=0.43). *   A strong correlation was found between inmate participation in the MAT program and filled FSA positions (R2=0.98). *   **Overall, no trends** were indicated that changes in BOP employee numbers affected inmate participation in drug treatment programs. The analysis emphasizes that findings are correlational and don’t imply causation.

      "summary": "Attorney’s Office and Jeffrey Epstein for state charges related to trafficking and sexual exploitation. The core of the agreement revolved around Epstein receiving a two-year state prison sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. Several factors shaped the negotiation: concerns about federal prosecution, the potential for a more severe federal sentence, and a desire to avoid a protracted legal battle.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office expressed concerns about Epstein's potential for further harm and wanted to ensure he received a jail sentence and registration. A key point of contention was the inclusion of a “non-admission of guilty” clause in the NPA, which provided broad immunity for potential co-conspirators.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office argued this was necessary to minimize the risk of further legal action, though it faced criticism later for its broad scope. The negotiation involved multiple individuals, including the lead U.S. Attorney, his deputy, and defense counsel, with the understanding that the plea was a strategic move, and the terms were ultimately subject to legal scrutiny.  A significant factor was the defense's resistance to the plea agreement and repeated attempts to renegotiate terms, particularly the immunity clause.  The U.S. Attorney viewed this as a tactic to delay the process and potentially obtain a more favorable outcome. Ultimately, the two-year state sentence was secured, with the NPA incorporating specific provisions addressing the immunity clause and restitution.",

Staff must document refusal to sign and, if an inmate is unable to comprehend the waiver or is undergoing mental health treatment, refer them for an assessment. The waiver is maintained as a permanent record, and inmates can request a copy.
