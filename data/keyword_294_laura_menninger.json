Historical data from June 1, 2020, to the present shows the device was located in the District of New Hampshire for the past 30 days. *   **Related Charges:** Maxwell is suspected of violating 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to entice minors), 2422/2423 (enticement/transportation of minors), 1623 (perjury), and related offenses. She has been indicted by a grand jury for these charges. *   **Evidence & Contacts:** The affidavit details Maxwell’s connections to other individuals (Laura Menninger, Haddon, Morgan & Foreman, Isabel Maxwell, Scott Borgerson) through phone records, indicating potential involvement in the scheme. *   **Sealed Warrant & Delay of Notice:** The warrant request includes a request to keep the application and warrant sealed until further order, due to the ongoing investigation and the potential for Maxwell to flee or obstruct justice. It also requests a delay of notification to prevent this. *   **Technical Details:** The document explains the investigative technique used – employing a device that can interrupt or monitor cellular communications – and addresses compliance with the Pen Register Statute.",

The production process involves multiple stages (6a, 6b, 6c), re-stamping, and transferring data to a location (USa.doj.govkcloud NYSkStAndrews\\ Shared). *   **Technical Issues & Corrections:** Significant issues arise regarding the accuracy of Bates numbering, metadata gaps in DAT files, and missing documents. Proposals are made to rectify these problems, including renumbering files, providing new DAT files, and correcting metadata errors. *   **Communication Chain:** The communication is primarily between USANYS (contractor) and the defense counsel (USANYS), with several individuals (e.g., Christian Everdell, Mark S. Cohen, Laura Menninger) involved in coordinating the production. *   **Timeline & Deadlines:** The document highlights ongoing efforts to prepare and deliver the discovery materials by January 27th, 2021, with ongoing requests for updates and confirmation of delivery. *   **Specific Requests & Concerns:** The defense requests a new 4TB hard drive, confirmation of the CD's delivery, clarification of Bates numbering, and detailed explanations for any missing documents or redactions. They also raise concerns regarding the FBI report and the tracking of the subject. *   **Redaction & Confidentiality:** The document is heavily redacted, indicating sensitive information is being protected.

      "summary": "Laura Menninger (Haddon, Morgan & Foreman, P.C.) requests permission to review FBI evidence in the US v. Maxwell case, citing deficiencies in the FBI’s initial proposal. She argues that the proposed viewing arrangement lacks adequate facilities for a thorough review, including access to laptops, and the ability for her client to examine discovery materials like recordings. Specifically, she requests: the transport of physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street with her client’s presence, permission to bring laptops and a camera, provision of equipment to play recordings, segregation of “highly confidential” evidence, and a secure room for client consultation. The FBI responds with a detailed proposal outlining the evidence’s categorization (electronic images from Epstein’s devices, discs, and hard copies), stipulations about accessing electronic files (Cellebrite software), arrangements for the physical evidence’s location at the Bronx warehouse, and conditions for reviewing the evidence. The FBI also addresses concerns about the volume of “highly confidential” images and their handling, proposing a phased approach to reviewing them. Finally, the FBI confirms the availability of a single laptop for reviewing the sensitive images and anticipates providing access to the evidence media within three weeks.",

Requests are made for metadata overlays. *   **Hard Drive Delivery:** The Assistant US Attorney is requesting the delivery of a hard drive containing the discovery materials to Ms. Maxwell, but the other party is hesitant and proposes alternative solutions. *   **Missing Production Numbers:** A gap exists between production numbers 11/18 and 12/18, and the Assistant US Attorney is inquiring about its intentionality. *   **Coordination & Support:** The Assistant US Attorney is requesting a call to discuss these issues and offers to assist with providing materials to Ms. Maxwell. *   **Redactions:** The document contains redactions, indicating the presence of sensitive or confidential information.",

Draft cover letters and attached files (DOCX documents) were included. *   **Metadata Issues:** The USANYS team identifies significant issues with the metadata associated with many of the recovered electronic files, including missing dates, incorrect file creation/modification dates, and a lack of CART numbers. *   **Requests for Clarification & Production:** Laura Menninger requests a detailed metadata overlay for files with altered dates, asks for a list of carved/deleted files, and requests CART numbers for specific photographs. *   **Addressing the Drive Issue:** There is discussion about sending a hard drive containing the discovery to the recipient, contingent on the recipient's ability to access it. *   **Missing Attachments:** A large number of emails lack attachments, requiring the USANYS to seek these out. *   **Ongoing Investigation:** The USANYS team is investigating the Bates gap (missing files) and working with a vendor to determine the best way to convey the metadata information. *   **Confirmation of Non-Recovery:** The USANYS confirms that certain attachments were not recovered from searched devices. *   **Multiple Requests for Additional Information:** The assistant US attorney repeatedly requests more information about the discovery materials and the metadata associated with them. **Essentially, the document outlines a challenging discovery process complicated by metadata discrepancies and the need for clarification on missing files and production methods.**",

Specifically, investigators are struggling to locate attached files and determine the source of files with altered dates. *   **CART Numbers & File Tracking:** A specific concern is the lack of CART numbers for numerous photographs and audio/visual files, leading to difficulties in tracking their origin and processing. *   **Requests for Additional Information:** The prosecution repeatedly requests missing attachments, metadata overlays, and clarification on Bates number gaps to facilitate a complete review of the discovery materials. *   **Coordination Efforts:** The exchanges involve coordinating with the MDC (presumably the court’s electronic discovery unit) and exploring options like a hard drive transfer and potential court orders to compel the provision of missing materials.

The prosecution (represented by Laura Menninger and Jeff Pagliuca) initially proposed November 29, 2021, but later suggested November 15th as a compromise.  The defense emphasized the need for a speedy trial and raised concerns about the government’s failure to provide specifics justifying the preferred date.  Scheduling conflicts related to Laura Menninger’s other trial and the need to review 3500 material were also discussed, with the defense linking these to the request for a speedy trial.  A key point of contention is the potential exclusion of Speedy Trial Act time, which the defense opposes unless Ms. Maxwell is released on bail. Communication primarily occurred through email, with a focus on establishing a trial date by the end of the year.",
