Berman and Reid Weingarten, is seeking detention due to Epstein’s alleged risk of flight and danger presented by his conduct, including alleged exploitation of underage girls and potential witness tampering. Epstein is represented by attorneys Martin Weinberg and Reid Weingarten.  The judge informed Epstein of his rights, and the parties discussed the charges, the government’s desire for detention, and the scheduling of a detention hearing for Thursday, July 11th. Key points include the government’s arguments focusing on Epstein’s wealth, mobility, and past conduct (specifically, the Florida investigation and nonprosecution agreement), and the defense’s assertion that the charges relate to an older period of conduct and questioning the scope of the nonprosecution agreement. The case is being considered in light of a potential statute of limitations issue and concerns about the victims involved.",

The court explained Epstein’s rights as a defendant, and the government sought detention pending trial, citing significant risk of flight and danger due to Epstein’s wealth, international travel, and previous offenses. The defense argued that the charges were based on old conduct and that the non-prosecution agreement in Florida was not applicable, requesting a continuance to present their case.
