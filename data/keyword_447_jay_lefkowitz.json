      "summary": "On November 27, 2007, an Assistant U.S. Attorney (USAFLS) communicated with Jay Lefkowitz regarding the selection of Judge Davis for a case involving Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg, representing Jeffrey Epstein. The sender initially misspelled Josephsberg’s name and inquired about Lefkowitz’s inclusion on the email chain. The sender noted that Podhurst and Josephsberg were well-known within the Epstein defense team and had strong reputations. The sender asserted a statutory obligation to notify victims of upcoming events and insisted on the completion of the vetting process by November 28, 2007, threatening to authorize victim notification if objections were not provided. A draft notification letter to the victims was planned for distribution after November 29, 2007.",

Lefkowitz, Esq., regarding Acosta’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Acosta disputes Lefkowitz’s claims of obstruction, manipulation, and inappropriate conduct, arguing that he acted in Epstein’s best interest, navigated complex legal issues, and diligently pursued the case. Key points include: *   **Dispute over Ocariz:** Acosta defends his choice to involve Bert Ocariz, explaining it was based on a friendship and the need for a trusted advisor, and denies any financial benefit. *   **Negotiation Efforts:** Acosta asserts he engaged in extensive negotiations with Lefkowitz and others, diligently investigating potential charges and attempting to reach a plea agreement. *   **Victim Handling:** He clarifies his approach to notifying victims, stating that notifications were carefully managed and not done prematurely to avoid undermining the investigation. *   **Investigation Integrity:** Acosta refutes allegations of hiding information or manipulating the investigation, pointing to the incorporation of investigative findings into the indictment package. *   **Strategic Criticism:** He expresses frustration with Lefkowitz’s attempts to discredit him and the Office, urging him to address concerns directly rather than making public accusations. Essentially, Acosta is presenting himself as a competent and ethical attorney who was unfairly targeted by Lefkowitz's criticisms.",

Acosta expressed concern about attempts to interpret the agreement, citing ongoing litigation and potential delays. He proposed reverting to a shorter victim list from 2007, contingent on prosecution of new crimes, and requested a decision by Friday morning regarding compensation for all victims known to the U.S. as of June 30, 2008. Acosta planned to use a standardized notification letter format, incorporating language from previous agreements, and sought feedback by the following afternoon.",
