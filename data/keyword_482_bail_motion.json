These conditions include a substantial bond ($28.5 million), real property, cash, asset monitoring by a retired judge, renunciation of British and French citizenship, waivers of extradition rights, confinement in New York City, GPS monitoring, and a third-party custodian.  Maxwell contends that the government is unfairly opposing the bail package, attempting to avoid addressing the merits of the case and relying on unfounded arguments. She challenges the government’s assertion that she poses an “extreme risk of flight,” arguing that the bail package is sufficient and highlighting weaknesses in the government’s case, including the lack of evidence of a criminal conspiracy and misleading of the court by government prosecutors. The government’s position is that a decision on this bail motion could complicate an appeal currently pending, and therefore jurisdiction should be deferred. Maxwell further challenges the government’s argument regarding her French nationality, arguing that it should not be used to bar extradition. Finally, she points to the difficulties she is facing with accessing electronic discovery materials.",
