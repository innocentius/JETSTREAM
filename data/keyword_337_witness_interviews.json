      "summary": "This document outlines procedures for the creation and operation of Boards of Inquiry and Inquiry Teams within the U.S. Department of Justice’s Federal Bureau of Prisons. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: *   **Purpose:** These teams investigate incidents and situations, gathering evidence, determining causes, and recommending corrective steps. They’re primarily used for significant or unusual incidents. *   **Authority:** The Director creates Boards of Inquiry, while Regional Directors or Wardens create Inquiry Teams (with Director approval). *   **OIA Involvement:** The Office of Internal Affairs (OIA) plays a crucial role, particularly in staff misconduct cases, ensuring employee rights and evidence preservation. An OIA member is typically included on Boards of Inquiry involving misconduct. OIA also assists teams with consultations and expenses. *   **Reporting Requirements:** Reports must be detailed, including recommendations, and may be subject to release under FOIA or subpoena if related to legal proceedings. *   **Team Composition:** Boards and Teams can include Bureau staff, legal counsel, and external experts. Regional Teams should avoid solely consisting of staff from one institution. *   **Interview Procedures:** Strict guidelines govern witness interviews, including advising on rights, confidentiality, and potential legal implications (e.g., Miranda rights if criminal misconduct is suspected). *   **Documentation:** Comprehensive records (notes, photos, recordings) are preserved throughout the inquiry process. Essentially, this document establishes a formalized process for investigating incidents within the Bureau of Prisons, emphasizing thoroughness, legal considerations, and accountability.",

Initially, the DOJ requested confirmation of an interview with Prince Andrew and a commitment from him to cooperate, stating their standard practice is to refrain from public comments on witness interviews. Bloxsome confirmed this practice, emphasizing the confidentiality of the investigation. Subsequently, the DOJ, through Assistant U.S. Attorney Berman, publicly stated that Prince Andrew hadn’t cooperated, correcting a perceived misimpression. Bloxsome challenged this statement, arguing it was inaccurate and potentially damaging to his client's ability to cooperate.  He requested a factual record of the DOJ’s statements and emphasized the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of the investigation. A series of emails followed, outlining the DOJ’s continued requests for an interview, Bloxsome’s concerns about public commentary, and efforts to schedule a preliminary call to discuss the matter. The core issue revolves around the DOJ’s insistence on obtaining a voluntary interview from Prince Andrew while Bloxsome attempts to protect his client's confidentiality and prevent any misrepresentation of the situation.",

      "summary": "Department of Justice (DOJ), specifically an Assistant U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York, regarding an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes and potential involvement of Prince Andrew. The DOJ was requesting an interview with Prince Andrew. Bloxsome initially stated that the DOJ’s position would be reflected upon and a response provided. He emphasized the DOJ’s standard practice of not commenting on witness interviews and maintaining confidentiality.  He highlighted that Prince Andrew had expressed a desire to cooperate. Subsequently, on January 27, 2020, the Assistant U.S. Attorney emailed further, correcting a public misimpression created by Prince Andrew regarding his willingness to cooperate, asserting that he had not provided any such cooperation.  This prompted Bloxsome to push back, arguing that the DOJ’s statements were inaccurate and detrimental to Prince Andrew’s efforts to cooperate. A series of follow-up emails occurred between January 28th and January 20th, primarily revolving around scheduling a preliminary phone call to discuss the matter.  The DOJ continued to express its desire for an interview and the need for confirmation of the Duke’s willingness to participate. The correspondence detailed the DOJ’s prior attempts to contact the Duke and the lack of a response. The emails revealed ongoing concerns about the potential for public misinterpretations regarding the Duke’s cooperation.",

Initially, the U.S. Attorney requests information on conference numbers and expresses a desire to speak with Bloxsome. Bloxsome responds, emphasizing the need for confidentiality and outlining standard UK legal practice regarding witness interviews. He expresses concern about public statements made by the U.S. Attorney’s office. The U.S. Attorney reiterates their desire for a voluntary interview, highlighting the conditions under which it would occur, and expresses frustration with what they perceive as a lack of engagement from Bloxsome.  Bloxsome continues to advocate for a cooperative approach, emphasizing the need for protections and a commitment to a voluntary interview, while the U.S. Attorney insists on pursuing a compelled interview through legal channels.  Throughout the exchanges, the U.S. Attorney references prior communications and the need to prevent a media circus.
