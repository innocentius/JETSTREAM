Requests are made for metadata overlays. *   **Hard Drive Delivery:** The Assistant US Attorney is requesting the delivery of a hard drive containing the discovery materials to Ms. Maxwell, but the other party is hesitant and proposes alternative solutions. *   **Missing Production Numbers:** A gap exists between production numbers 11/18 and 12/18, and the Assistant US Attorney is inquiring about its intentionality. *   **Coordination & Support:** The Assistant US Attorney is requesting a call to discuss these issues and offers to assist with providing materials to Ms. Maxwell. *   **Redactions:** The document contains redactions, indicating the presence of sensitive or confidential information.",

The prosecution (represented by Laura Menninger and Jeff Pagliuca) initially proposed November 29, 2021, but later suggested November 15th as a compromise.  The defense emphasized the need for a speedy trial and raised concerns about the government’s failure to provide specifics justifying the preferred date.  Scheduling conflicts related to Laura Menninger’s other trial and the need to review 3500 material were also discussed, with the defense linking these to the request for a speedy trial.  A key point of contention is the potential exclusion of Speedy Trial Act time, which the defense opposes unless Ms. Maxwell is released on bail. Communication primarily occurred through email, with a focus on establishing a trial date by the end of the year.",
