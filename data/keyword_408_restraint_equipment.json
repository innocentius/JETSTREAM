The log recorded counts, security checks (including metal detectors and restraint equipment), fire/sprinkler system status, inmate movement (including FURLs and Administrative Detention), and communication checks (NYPD phone checks and STG/High Alert calls).  There were multiple institutional counts throughout the day, often accompanied by “Good Verbal” or “Clear” announcements.  Several system malfunctions (specifically PREA announcements) were noted. The shift involved managing inmate activities, conducting trash runs, and responding to inmate inquiries and potential security concerns.

Key events include: *   **Initial Counts:** The log begins with initial counts of 756 inmates, with varying numbers in Special Housing Units (SHU). *   **Operational Issues:** Frequent reports of system malfunctions, particularly with the Public Address System, lead to delays in announcements and procedures. *   **Inmate Management:** Several inmates are placed on suicide watch, requiring companion assignments and administrative detention. *   **Security Procedures:** Regular counts, metal detector checks, restraint equipment inventories, and roof checks are conducted. *   **Phone Monitoring:** STG and High Alert phone calls are monitored, with no WITSEC inquiries received during the shift. *   **Shift Changes:** The Lieutenant transitions between morning, day, and evening shifts, each with specific duties and observations. The log consistently records counts, inmate movements, and operational issues encountered throughout the shifts.",
