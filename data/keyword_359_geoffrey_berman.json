United States Attorney Geoffrey Berman and defense attorneys Reid Weingarten, Martin Weinberg, and Marc Fernich appeared on behalf of the prosecution and defendant, respectively. Epstein is charged with two counts: sex trafficking conspiracy and the substantive offense of sex trafficking, allegedly involving the sexual abuse of underage girls at his residences in New York and Florida. The court explained Epstein’s rights as a defendant, and the government sought detention pending trial, citing significant risk of flight and danger due to Epstein’s wealth, international travel, and previous offenses. The defense argued that the charges were based on old conduct and that the non-prosecution agreement in Florida was not applicable, requesting a continuance to present their case. The court scheduled a detention hearing for July 11, 2019, at 2:00 PM, and ordered Epstein to be detained.",

Berman, with representatives from the U.S. Attorney’s Office and defense counsel present. **Key Events and Participants:** *   **Initial Housekeeping:** Judge Berman addressed the participants, outlining the purpose of the hearing—to consider the motion to dismiss due to Epstein’s death. He also acknowledged the significant effort involved and expressed gratitude for the work of the prosecutors and victims. *   **Government’s Argument:** The government, led by Geoffrey Berman, argued that the death of Epstein necessitated the dismissal of the case due to the lack of a live defendant. They emphasized the need for a full and transparent investigation and highlighted the potential for further investigation into co-conspirators. They referenced the legal precedent set by the *U.S. v. Wright* case concerning abatement. *   **Defense’s Argument:** Defense counsel, led by Reid Weingarten, strongly opposed the dismissal, arguing that the court had an inherent authority to continue investigating and pursuing justice, regardless of Epstein's death. They raised concerns about the government’s handling of the investigation and questioned the credibility of the medical examiner’s findings regarding the cause of death. They invoked precedent from *U.S. v. Heaton* and suggested the possibility of a parallel investigation by the court. *   **Victim Testimonies:** Multiple Jane Doe victims, represented by Gloria Allred’s firm, offered statements detailing their experiences and the ongoing trauma caused by Epstein’s actions. They expressed a desire for justice and accountability. *   **Legal Discussions:** Throughout the hearing, the lawyers discussed relevant legal principles, including the “abatement” doctrine, the Crime Victims' Rights Act, and the role of the government in investigating and prosecuting crimes. The discussion centered on the court’s authority to continue the case despite Epstein's death. **Outcome (as presented):** The hearing concluded with Judge Berman stating that he would consider the arguments and would likely move forward with an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death, reinforcing the importance of victims’ rights and ongoing investigation. **Additional Notes:** *   The text contains several references to ongoing investigations and potential further legal action. *   There were discussions regarding the handling of evidence, the role of the FBI, and the need for transparency in the investigation. *   The hearing showcased the complex legal and ethical issues involved in a case where the defendant has died before a trial concludes.",

      "summary": "Prince Andrew denied claims from Geoffrey Berman, U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, that he refused to cooperate with the FBI in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Andrew stated no requests had been made, while Berman’s office maintained they had made multiple attempts to contact Andrew’s representatives. Andrew expressed anger and bewilderment regarding the allegations, and a source close to him stated he was awaiting contact from the FBI. Law enforcement sources affirmed Berman’s claims. Duncan Levin, a former prosecutor, viewed the situation as evidence of the authorities’ determination to investigate the complex network surrounding Epstein.",
