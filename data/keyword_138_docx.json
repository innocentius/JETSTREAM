Draft cover letters and attached files (DOCX documents) were included. *   **Metadata Issues:** The USANYS team identifies significant issues with the metadata associated with many of the recovered electronic files, including missing dates, incorrect file creation/modification dates, and a lack of CART numbers. *   **Requests for Clarification & Production:** Laura Menninger requests a detailed metadata overlay for files with altered dates, asks for a list of carved/deleted files, and requests CART numbers for specific photographs. *   **Addressing the Drive Issue:** There is discussion about sending a hard drive containing the discovery to the recipient, contingent on the recipient's ability to access it. *   **Missing Attachments:** A large number of emails lack attachments, requiring the USANYS to seek these out. *   **Ongoing Investigation:** The USANYS team is investigating the Bates gap (missing files) and working with a vendor to determine the best way to convey the metadata information. *   **Confirmation of Non-Recovery:** The USANYS confirms that certain attachments were not recovered from searched devices. *   **Multiple Requests for Additional Information:** The assistant US attorney repeatedly requests more information about the discovery materials and the metadata associated with them. **Essentially, the document outlines a challenging discovery process complicated by metadata discrepancies and the need for clarification on missing files and production methods.**",
