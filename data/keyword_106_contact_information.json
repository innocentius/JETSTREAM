The Defendant objected to some redactions. *   **Lugosch Test:** The Court applied the “Lugosch” test (determining if judicial documents are “judicial documents,” weighing presumption of access, and balancing competing interests) to justify redactions. This test considers the danger to law enforcement, judicial efficiency, and privacy interests. *   **Redactions Granted:** The Court granted the Government’s redaction requests for documents related to third parties’ privacy interests, particularly concerning “family affairs” and contact information. *   **Redactions Denied:** The Court denied the Government’s redaction requests for portions of the brief related to sealed proceedings concerning grand jury subpoenas, stating that such redactions would impede an ongoing investigation. *   **Further Action:** The Government is ordered to either file the documents without redaction or justify tailored redactions by March 22, 2021, and to propose redactions for Exhibit 11 by the same date.",
