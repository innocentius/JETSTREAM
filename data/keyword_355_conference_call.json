Key issues raised include: the disorganized nature of the data transfers, a lack of device identification, difficulty linking emails to attachments, problems with the database structure (no links between native files and the loaded data), and inconsistencies in descriptions of seized items. Several individuals (Joseph Picarelli, FBI representatives, and US Attorney staff) attempted to establish a system for tracking the data, proposing spreadsheets and meetings to address the challenges of reviewing and processing the materials. There were concerns about duplicate data, the need for a standardized labeling system for devices, and the difficulty in correlating information between the search warrant returns and the actual seized items. The initial data transfer from a hard drive included both existing and potentially new materials, causing confusion about what had already been provided.  The ultimate goal was to establish a clear process for tracking and reviewing the seized data to facilitate the legal proceedings.",
