      "summary": "The documents detail discussions surrounding a proposed compensation program for Epstein victims, spearheaded by Jordy Feldman, Ken Feinberg, and Camille Biros. Roberta Kaplan, representing a group of victims, expresses concerns that the Estate’s involvement—particularly the selection of the decision-makers—renders the program non-independent and insufficient to meet the needs of the plaintiffs. Kaplan proposes adding a fourth administrator chosen by the plaintiffs to ensure a truly independent process. Jordy Feldman responds, emphasizing the program’s voluntary and independent nature, outlining the drafting of a proposed protocol and inviting Kaplan’s input.  Magistrate Judge Freeman has instructed the parties to engage in good-faith discussions regarding the program's development, with a deadline of January 10, 2019, for an update.  The core issue revolves around ensuring the victims' voices and interests are adequately represented within the settlement process.",
